<p>Now spring is here, I feel the need to lighten up my meals a little.  Green smoothies are my go-to for a quick and easy lunch.  There are so many recipes that can be found online and books devoted to these amazing green glasses of goodness.  Now I won't tell a lie,  although I love the flavour of green smoothies, I find the texture of smoothies a little challenging.  I can't handle sipping it out of the glass and it is too thick for a straw, so I have combated this by using a spoon to 'eat' my smoothie.  It's a personal thing and I'm sure most people wouldn't encounter this!  I make mine up in my Thermomix, but you can use any kitchen blender to mix it up.  If you haven't tried one, give it a go, I'm sure you won't find a much quicker and more satisfying beverage.  It's dairy free and gluten free too.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br />
(This amount makes one serving)</p>
<p>2 good handfuls of spinach<br />
1 banana<br />
2 pitted dates<br />
1-2 tbsp Chia seeds<br />
Maple syrup or Agave syrup to taste<br />
100-200ml water (I use 2 cupfuls of Thermomix cup)</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Place all of the ingredients in a blender or Thermomix (I use speed 7 for about 30 seconds) and blend until well combined.   Once blended to your desired consistency, pour into a glass and drink as desired.</p>

<p>See, couldn't be easier.  Enjoy!  Jacinta x</p>
