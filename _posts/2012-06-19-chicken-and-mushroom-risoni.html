<p>I'm all for quick and easy weekday meals.  Especially when I know all the family will eat it without complaint.  Risoni (rice shaped pasta) cooks quickly and this meal only takes about 15 minutes cooking time and it only uses one pot, so not too many dishes!  I add a small dash of cream to the kids servings.  I love pepper on mine.  Parmesan cheese would go well with this dish too.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:<br />
Serves 4-5 </strong></p>
<p>2 chicken breast fillets, cut into small cubes<br />
1 cup risoni<br />
2 cups water<br />
1 onion, finely chopped<br />
1 clove garlic, crushed<br />
4 mushrooms, chopped finely<br />
2 rashers bacon, chopped<br />
1/2 tsp dried tarragon<br />
Chicken stock powder to taste<br />
small amount oil<br />
cream/Parmesan cheese optional</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Fry onion and garlic in a little oil for a couple of minutes, then add bacon and chicken.  Brown off chicken slightly then add the mushrooms and cook for approximately 1 minute.  Then add tarragon, risoni, water and chicken stock powder.  Stir well then cover the pan and reduce the heat.  Stir regularly to avoid the risoni sticking.  Cook until risoni is just tender.  Dish up into individual bowls and add a dash of cream or parmesan cheese if desired.</p>
