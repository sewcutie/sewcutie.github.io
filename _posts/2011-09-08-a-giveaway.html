<p>As promised in yesterdays post, I have a sweet little giveaway for you. The giveaway is for two wool felt flower clips and a sweet little mouse for that someone special.  The mouse is small enough to fit in a pocket to tote around on grand adventures. The clips and mouse are made by me, with love.</p>

<p>Entry is open to all.  Just leave a comment.  I will draw the giveaway next Monday 12th September (Australian time). Good luck!  Jacinta x</p>
