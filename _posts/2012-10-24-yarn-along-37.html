<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/10/yarn-along-99.html">Ginny</a> from Small Things this week.</p>
<p>It has been ages since I picked up my knitting.  It seems my shoulder that was giving me trouble and hindering my crafting, has thankfully started to feel a lot better (so long as I don't over do it).  I'm getting that sinking feeling that Christmas will be upon me before I know it, I am a feeling like I better get my knit on if I'm ever going to get any gifts ready for gifting!</p>
<p>Tonight I started casting on a cowl, it's my own pattern some of you might remember from earlier in the year, Sweet Memories Cowl.  I am using an Australian yarn called Bliss by Heirloom.  I made a different cowl with this yarn for a friend's birthday present.  It is lovely and soft against your skin.  I must say it is so exciting to see some of the other Sweet Memories Cowls starting to show up on <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/sweet-memories-cowl/people">Ravelry</a>.  The pattern for it is<a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1912"> here</a> if you are interested. Makes me want to design more things, I just need a parellel life to do so (don't we all)!</p>
<p>As for reading, I bought a copy of Country Style magazine today.  It's an Australia publication and has lots of inspiration for the home and garden.  Always has lovely stories about people and their homes too.  I don't buy many magazines, but once in a while, this one pops into my shopping basket!<br />
The novel I'm reading currently is called My Last Duchess, by Daisy Goodwin.  I think it is know as American Heiress in other countries though.  Based in the 1800's, the main character Cora, is a daughter from a very wealthy family, who sets off to Europe to find a suitable husband to marry.  The storyline follows along the trials and tribulations that come with living at that time as a woman.  Sometimes I find the character Cora a little frustrating, but then again, I have to remember that the time period this book is written in, women had very little rights and minds weren't spoken as they are now.  I will hold my judgement of the book until I have finished it.  I must admit that the cover of the book had a deciding factor in my purchasing it, even if it is a kindle book.</p>

<p>Can't wait to catch up on what everyone has been crafting and reading.  It seems too long since I last joined in.</p>
