<p>I love to spread the message about good customer service and/or businesses.  I have to give a big thank you to <a href="http://www.duckcloth.com.au/">Duckcloth</a>.  I ordered some fabric yesterday afternoon and it was in my mailbox this morning.  Talk about efficient.  How gorgeous is the unicorn fabric in the green colour way from Heather Ross.  It's for Scarlett, my horse/unicorn crazy girl.  The squirrels are by Sproud Design.  They are for Tenneille.  After all, she does love her <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1042">squirrels</a>.  Now the fun part, deciding what I am going to make.  May be one of these <a href=" http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=120 ">skirts</a> or pillow covers perhaps.</p>

<p>Now, if my Etsy goodies (not from Duckcloth) I ordered <em>1 month ago</em> could turn up so I can get Tenneille's bedroom finished, I'd be a happy woman.</p>
<p>Please feel free to share links to businesses that you love too.   Jacinta x</p>
