<p><em>- Keepin’ It Real captures the true essence of family life that I know is fleeting, keeping this mama grounded -</em></p>
<p>It's been 'one of those' days.  I am in bed and it is only 7.30pm.  I'm wondering if there is some cosmic misalignment that I wasn't aware of?  On my bedside table there is a bunch of freesias (my favourite flowers of all), some flourless chocolate cake and a hot cup of tea.  I will revive myself and have an early night.  Tomorrow is a new day and I want to face it with strength and vigor.  I've been battling with a chronic shoulder issue that is weighing me down somewhat and I know it is a sign to take it easy, but it is such a hard lesson to follow with spring in the air.  With that gorgeous spring air comes a half an acre of land that is about to burst into life (ok, weeds), but it will have to wait a little longer for me to tend it.  So for now, I will enjoy my cuppa while it is still hot and savour every mouthful of the decadent chocolate cake and perhaps peruse my <a href="http://www.diggers.com.au/">Diggers Club</a> catalogue that still taunts me in it's yet-to-be opened packaging.  Oh yes, forget fashion catalogues darling, a garden catalogue wins me over every time!  Yes, I think I am ready to face tomorrow.</p>

<p>Much love to you, my dear readers.  Jacinta x</p>
