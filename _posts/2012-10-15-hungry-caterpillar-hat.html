<p>I'm so excited to show you Jairah's finished hat.  I borrowed quite a bit of time from my day yesterday, but so glad I did!  Jairah was more than happy to participate in a photo shoot today and thankfully the weather behaved itself and it didn't rain.  It was really hard to narrow down which photos to choose, the poser Jairah is.  He is always happy to flash a cheeky smile for the camera.  The hat it fully reversible, so imagine the endless combinations of fabrics you could use.  Some scrap material was salvaged and sewed onto a plain tee-shirt, because we all know it is fun to accessorise, right?  I can happily recommend the pattern.  I made the largest size (21") for Jairah and although it's a little too big, it still sits well on his head.  So tempted to make more!  But then, my list of 'to sew' items is longer than I may ever have time for, so who knows.</p>
