<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/08/yarn-along-89.html">Ginny</a> from Small Things.</p>
<p>I'm so excited to say my mystery project from last week is finished!  I called it Sweet Memories Cowl.  Very happy with how it came up.  The Zara Chiné yarn is so lovely and soft, perfect for against your neck, no hint of scratchiness.  I posted about it <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1912">here</a>.  It is also listed as a free pattern on <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/sweet-memories-cowl">Ravelry</a> , I am excited to say, as it is my first 'published' project.  Let me know if you try the pattern out.  I'd love to see pictures too!</p>
<p>I'm still working on the Beyond Puerperium that I originally started for a friend's baby, that ended up too big.  It will be Jairah's once finished.</p>

<p>As for reading, still plugging away at, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Kashmir-Shawl-ebook/dp/B005AYIA3K/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345024509&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+kashmir+shawl">The Kashmir Shawl</a>.  I'm trying to sneak in any reading time possible, as it is starting to get interesting.  While at the library with the kids the other day, I came across, Anne Frank by Susanna Davidson.  I was drawn to all the photos.  It is written for the younger reader, so it should be a quick read.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what you have all created this week.  Jacinta x</p>
