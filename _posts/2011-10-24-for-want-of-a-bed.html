<p>Cardamon was in need of a new doggy bed.  The one he had had seen better days and we were constantly tripping over it.  So off I went with the kids to see what we could find.  It seemed everything we looked at was expensive and not very well made.  I had an idea and whipped the kids off with me to Kmart.  One basket, one pillow and one pillow case later, I think he has a pretty special bed.  He is currently curled up in his new basket sound asleep. That is proof enough for me that he likes his new digs.</p>

<p>1 basket $14<br />
1 pillow $4<br />
1 pillowcase $5<br />
Total $23</p>
