<p>Now if only you could smell these freesias.  We stopped off at a roadside where thousands of freesias grow in a rampant fashion.  It's a spot we stop at every spring and I love gathering the flowers along side the girls, where they go skipping from flower to flower talking in sing-song voices.  I am actually beginning to wonder if freesias give off some sort of happy pheromone?</p>

<p>They are now sitting on our kitchen bench and I feel I may pass out any minute from deeply inhaling their scent.  I-can't-help-myself!  Now where is the scratch and snif app. for computers/laptops/phones?  Come on Apple, surely you could come up with something like that?</p>
<p>Ok, looks like you will have to imagine the fragrance instead.  Jacinta x</p>
