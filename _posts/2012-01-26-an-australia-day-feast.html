<p>We quietly celebrated Australia Day at home, I wrangled kids while Greg finished some paintwork, all very ho-hum really.  But dinner was a yummy 'Australian themed' meal including lamb and pavlova.  The kids loved the lamb meatballs and the pav went down a treat.  So much so, I'm sharing my recipes with you.  I hope you enjoyed your day, however you chose to celebrate Australia Day.  Oh, I have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81_KP56oL0">seen this video</a> floating round in the cyber world, it's so tongue in cheek, and oh so ocker, I just had to share.</p>

<p><strong>Fetta &amp; Olive Lamb Meatballs</strong></p>
<p>I am letting you in on a secret, steaming the meatballs before pan frying helps them keep their shape and they tend not to stick.</p>
<p>1kg lamb mince<br />
1/2 cup olives, pitted<br />
120gm marinated fetta<br />
2 cloves garlic<br />
1/2 red onion<br />
oil for cooking</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>In a food processor, place the onion and garlic and process until finely chopped.  Add olives and fetta and process until coarsely chopped.  Add this mix to a bowl and then add mince.  Mix thoroughly.  Roll mixture into balls, using a little water on your hands to prevent mixture sticking.  Using a bamboo steamer or the like, place the meatballs in and steam them for approximately 10 minutes.  You may need to do this in batches, depending on the size of your steamer.  Remove meatballs from steamer and place on absorbent paper.  Once they have cooled a little, pour approximately 3 tablespoons oil into a pan over a medium heat, adding the meatballs and cook until golden brown.  Remove from pan and serve immediately.  Serve with a nice green salad and your favourite dipping sauce if desired.</p>

<p><strong>Pavlova</strong></p>
<p>4 egg whites<br />
3/4 cup castor sugar<br />
300 ml cream, whipped<br />
seasonal fruit of your choice</p>
<p>Beat egg whites until soft peaks form, approximately 1-2 minutes.  Gradually add sugar, making sure it is fully disolved between additions.  Place mixture on a tray lined with baking paper and spread to a diameter of about 20-25 cm.  Place in a very slow oven approximately 120 degrees celsius or for a fan forced oven approximately 100-110 degrees celsius for 1 - 1 1/2 hours.  Once cooked through, turn off oven and leave the oven door ajar allowing the pavlova to fully cool before removing.  Place on a serving dish and decorate with whipped cream and fruit of your choice.  My preference is fresh passionfruit pulp, strawberries and blueberries.</p>
