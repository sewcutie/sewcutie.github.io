<p>I completely forgot about this book until today.  I ordered it many months ago, from <a href="http://www.fishpond.com.au/Books/I-Am-Cute-Dresses-Sato-Watanabe/9781596683518">here</a>, flicked through it, placed it in my bedside table drawer, then promptly forgot about it.  While bathing in the beautiful sunshine that was filtering through our dining room window this afternoon, I was daydreaming about some craft projects I'd like to make for myself, when the book suddenly popped into mind (a craft epiphany perhaps?).</p>
<p>The book was one of those purchases where the dress on the front cover won me over, ok the title helped some too, but wasn't sure what other projects were in the book.  Google didn't show up much about the book, so on a whim, I ordered it.  I'm happy to say that there are quite a few projects I love and can't wait to start on.  There are no paper patterns per say, but detailed diagrams of measurements.  The dresses are designed to be loose fitting and are kind of one-size-fits-all.  Could be interesting, but then I like to sew by the seat of my pants and as my sewing opportunities are very few and far between, anything that saves time, means I am more likely to finish a project as opposed to adding to my UFO stash!</p>

I love this tunic top. Would be lovely over pants.[/caption]</p>

Hmm, chances of actually getting just one sewn?[/caption]</p>
<p>Now to find the perfect material.  Life is terrible isn't it!  If you have a favourite clothing book, please feel free to share.  There are so many out there it's nice to hear recommendations.  Jacinta x</p>
