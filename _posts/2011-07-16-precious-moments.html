<p>It's funny, I was just thinking today about the price I pay for my craft 'passions' as I was happily sanding a toy for Jairah out in the freezing cold and thinking about all the other jobs that waited for me inside.  But the girls were contented playing a game indoors and Jairah was outside with me doing his own thing.  I was for a time free so I figured it was a precious moment not to be wasted on housework, but to do something that I wanted to do.  I figure craft is my way of giving back to myself and for me that is better than being up to date with the washing pile or the other jobs I knew weren't going anywhere without me doing them today.  They will happily wait until tomorrow, my moment to craft may not.  Jacinta</p>
