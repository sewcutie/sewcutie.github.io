<p>I love this little pattern by Simplicity no. 5118.  I purchased it a few years ago and have made a couple of dresses in style A.  It makes up pretty quickly which is a bonus.  Both the girls have worn the dresses I originally made.  Tenneille tried one of the dresses on the other day and it is now more like a top.  So I decided that a new dress was in order.  I think I made Tenneille's day!</p>
