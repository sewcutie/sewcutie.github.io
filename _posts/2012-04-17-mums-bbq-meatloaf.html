<p>I love a good meal that feeds the family and is budget conscious too.  I think this meatloaf recipe fits the bill.  It has a lovely tang to it and it tastes nice both hot and cold.  This is one of those trusty recipes that has been in the family for a good 25 years.  I'm not sure where mum got the recipe from originally, but it's certainly worthy of sharing with you all.  I think the BBQ sauce would be nice on the likes of spare ribs or grilled chicken too.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meatloaf:</strong></p>
<p>500gm beef mince<br />
500gm sausage mince<br />
1 cup fresh breadcrumbs<br />
2 onions, finely chopped<br />
1/2 cup milk<br />
1/2 cup water<br />
1 egg<br />
1 tsp curry powder (can add up to a dessert spoon if you want it a bit more spicy)<br />
salt &amp; pepper to taste<br />
small amount of parsley optional</p>
<p><strong>BBQ Sauce:</strong></p>
<p>1/2 cup water<br />
1/2 cup tomato sauce<br />
1/4 cup worcestershire sauce<br />
1/4 cup brown sugar<br />
2 tbsp vinegar<br />
2 tbsp lemon juice<br />
1 tsp instant coffee powder<br />
1 small dob butter</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Combine all the meatloaf ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly.  Add meatloaf mix to a suitable ovenproof dish, making sure there is enough room at the top to add the BBQ sauce later.  Place meatloaf in a preheated oven @180 degrees celsius (350F).  Bake for 30 minutes.  The BBQ sauce ingredients need to be simmered for 5 minutes before pouring over the meatloaf.  Once you remove the meatloaf from the oven, skim off excess liquid, pour the pre-heated BBQ sauce over the meatloaf and return to the oven for a further 45 minutes.  Once cooked, serve with your favourite vegetables.</p>
