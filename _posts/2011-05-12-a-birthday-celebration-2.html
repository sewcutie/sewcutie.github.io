<p>Today is my birthday.  Yet another trip around the sun.   Although no sunshine to be seen today.  We have had some really cold weather here the last couple of days, with it snowing just up the road yesterday.  Today was foggy and drizzling.  Although I must admit living in the hills adds a mystical and most magical element to this wintery weather.</p>
<p>My mum came to spend time with us for my birthday and and gave me a leave pass this afternoon (I have been home all week with Scarlett being unwell).  I went to my favourite cafe in Sassafras called <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=166">Ripe</a> and enjoyed a quiet lunch and read my kindle book.  Bliss!  I then wandered to the local wool/yarn shop and proceeded to buy some lovely alpaca wool (pictures to come).  I think it will become a scarf and hat, as I feel we are in for some more arctic weather before winter is out.</p>
<p>Mum and Scarlett baked me a chocolate cake and the girls decorated it for me.  The concentration that went into that cake was amazing.</p>

<p>Happy birthday was sung and the kids helped blow the candles out.  I was sure Jairah would pass out from his candle blowing efforts.</p>

<p>I have received some lovely gifts from lovely friends and family.   I ordered myself some beautiful fabric, but that will have to be another post!</p>

<p>I am now parked in front of the open fire with Cardamon snuggled up next to me.  Ah, life is good.  Jacinta x</p>
