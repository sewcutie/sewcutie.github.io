<p>Our dear Tenneille is turning 7 this week.  We started her birthday celebration a little early with a party over the weekend.  We were blessed with the presence of her dear little school friends.  It was quite a hot day in the 30's, but that didn't curb the children's spirit.  We had them well scheduled with a treasure hunt, pass-the-parcel, pin the horn on the unicorn and a piñata, with yummy food in between to keep them going.</p>
<p>I made her a yummy dairy free/gluten free chocolate cake and used some lovely vegie based food colouring for the frosting which made the most gorgeous shade of blue.</p>
<p>I have spent the past week making her a party dress, foxes of course.  She was so excited to wear it (I'll write another post about it later in the week).<br />
