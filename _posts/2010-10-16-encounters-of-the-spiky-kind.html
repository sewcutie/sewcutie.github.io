<p>The other day Scarlett was calling me in a very exited voice to come and look at something.  The conversation went something like this; "Mama, come quick".  "What do you want Scarlett?".  "Come and look at this".  "What is this?".  "It's a, um, I can't remember what they are called, just look at this" (note: the excitement in her tone of voice was extreme by this stage!).  I was now at the window with Scarlett and low and behold, there is an echidna digging in the garden outside our lounge room window.  "It's an echidna", I explained.  "I knew that mama, I was just so excited I couldn't get the word out", said Scarlett. "Of course" I replied, what else could I say!  It is a bit of a treat to see them close up.  Normally around here we see them waddling along the side of the road, not up by the house.</p>
<p>By the time we got the camera it had gone around the corner of the house and of course, was hiding.  We took a couple of pictures and came back inside, knowing it wouldn't move while we were around.  The echidna proceeded to climb the steps up into the back garden.  What a sight to behold!  It sort of meandered, waddled and staggered it's way up the steps.  Didn't get photos of course, as I was too busy giggling to myself at the scene before me.   So this is the best I could do.</p>
