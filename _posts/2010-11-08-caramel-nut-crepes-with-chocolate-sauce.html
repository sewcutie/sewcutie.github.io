<p>These are always a hit.  Never any left overs!  The crepes, filling and chocolate sauce can all be made ahead of time.  In fact, this is the best way to make them as you need the filling to set before using in crepes.</p>
<p>Crepe Ingredients -</p>
<p>3/4 cup milk<br />
1/2 cup plain flour<br />
3 eggs<br />
100gm ground almonds<br />
2 tsp oil<br />
Cooking spray</p>
<p>Crepe Filling -</p>
<p>250gm butter<br />
250gm brown sugar<br />
100gm finely chopped almonds - toasted<br />
1 egg, beaten<br />
Chocolate Sauce Ingredients -</p>
<p>250gm dark cooking chocolate<br />
1/3 cup cream<br />
3 tbsp orange liquor (optional)</p>
<p>Method -</p>
<p>Crepes</p>
<p>Sift flour and place in bowl with ground almonds. Mix together eggs, oil and milk in a separate bowl.  Add liquid to flour and ground almonds.  Whisk until combined.  Place in fridge for at least one hour before cooking.  Place two tablespoons of mixture in pre-heated frypan coated with cooking spray.  Cook on one side, turn, cook and place on plate.  Cook until all the mixture is used.  Crepes can be stored for a few days, covered in the fridge.</p>
<p>Caramel nut filling -</p>
<p>Toast chopped almonds on an oven tray and place in oven @140 degrees celsius until toasted.  Put aside.  Place butter and brown sugar into a saucepan.  Heat over a medium heat until gently bubbling.  Stir for a further 5 minutes, or until sugar is dissolved.  Take off heat and pour into a heat-proof bowl.  Add chopped nuts and stir.  Once it is cooled slightly, whisk in the beaten egg until well beaten.  It is important not to have the mix too hot or the egg will cook and turn white.</p>
<p>Chocolate sauce -</p>
<p>Over a double saucepan filled with water, melt the chocolate.  Once melted, add the cream and stir until combined.  Add optional orange liquor and stir until mixed through.  The chocolate sauce keeps very well in the fridge.</p>
<p>To assemble -</p>
<p>Place a teaspoon full of the caramel filling in each crepe.  Fold the crepe into 4 and place in a oven tray that is lined with foil and baking paper to stop crepes sticking.  Make up as many crepes as desired.  Cover over with the baking paper and foil.  Place in oven @ 140 degrees celsius and cook for approximately 10 minutes.  Remove from oven and place on serving plates.  Serve with chocolate sauce drizzled over the top with an optional scoop of ice cream and perhaps a strawberry!</p>
