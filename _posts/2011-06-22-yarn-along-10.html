<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/06/yarn-along_15.html">Ginny at Small Things </a>yarn along this week.</p>
<p>Hurrah!  I have finished Scarlett's dress.  I had hoped to capture some pictures of her wearing it, but Wednesday is our crazy day, so I am hoping to take some better photos of her wearing it tomorrow to her school's winter festival.  It was a lovely knit and I am very happy with how it has turned out.</p>
<p>The colour is really off unfortunately, as I took the photo at 10.00pm tonight.</p>

<p>Now I am just deciding what to make for Jairah.  I have some lovely vintage and retro patterns (they have been my reading material this week!) that I am finding hard to choose from, as there are so many gorgeous patterns. I have bought<a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/ridinghood-sweater-pattern"> this</a> pattern for Tenneille and I have also purchased a lovely red yarn to knit it in.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what you have all been crafting this week.  Jacinta x</p>
