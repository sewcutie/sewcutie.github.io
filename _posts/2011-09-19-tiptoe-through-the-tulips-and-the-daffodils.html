<p>One thing about living in the hills is that we are spoilt for things to do in spring.  We have an abundance of bulb farms to visit and the girls always delight in such occasions.  We pass one on the way home from school and it has become a tradition that we stop and admire the flowering display before <del datetime="2011-09-19T10:00:09+00:00">arguing over</del> deciding on what bulbs we would like to bring home.  It seems some beautiful yellow tulips were the choice this year.  Of course there is much skipping, sniffing and ohhhing and arrring as we walk around the rows and rows of pretty blooms.  I just step back and try to capture the magic from a distance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.daffodilbulbs.com.au/">Hancock's Daffodil farm</a> flower display is open to the public in September and is located in Menzies Creek.  They are lovely people and it's well worth a visit if you happen to be in the Dandenong Ranges.  Jacinta x</p>
