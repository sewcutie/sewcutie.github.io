<p>I have decided to join in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/03/yarn-along_16.html">Ginny at Small Things</a> yarn along this week.</p>
<p>I have been working on sewing up a friend's baby blanket which is a blessingway gift for her baby.  Her babe has now arrived (a little girl) and so the pressure is on to get the blanket completed.  It is rather a technicolour blanket as there were no stipulations on what colour/colours to use, but I think she will love it regardless.  It has been a bit tricky as most people didn't leave a tail for me to use to sew their squares in with, so I think I am going to have to chase up some of their wool to finish it, as I want the seems to blend in.</p>
<p>I am actually reading a magazine at the moment.  It is a copy of Living Crafts from 2009.  I was visiting a friend the other day and she showed it to me and very kindly let me borrow it.  I am very tempted to try out the hand painting of wool featured in the magazine.  My daughter, Scarlett, has a birthday coming up and I thought it would be lovely to send the children home with a small ball of hand dyed wool as their party favour.</p>
