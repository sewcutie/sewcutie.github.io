<p>Tenneille had a birthday to go to recently and of course, in my usual fashion, had avoided the shops all week.  I thought I had found time to make the top from a version of <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1503">this dress pattern</a> I had used for Tenneille's birthday dress earlier in the year, but of course mothering duties called and it got to an hour before the party before I could get near my sewing machine.  This called for some quick thinking and I decided I could put a skirt together, without a pattern as such, in an hour, ahem!  Ok, so it took me an hour and a half.  Thankfully Greg took Tenneille to the party and I picked her up and delivered the present, talk about cutting it fine!</p>
