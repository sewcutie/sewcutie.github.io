<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/04/yarn-along_27.html">Ginny at Small Things </a>yarn along this week.</p>
<p>I cast on a new project this week.  I decided to go ahead and make Scarlett a dress from a pattern I shared in a <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=706">previous yarn along</a>.  At the time I'd purchased acrylic yarn suggested in the pattern and as much as I loved the colour, I didn't like the feel of the acrylic yarn.  I purchased some yarn this week that was 100% wool and only $3 a ball.  It's a very similar colour to what I was going to use.  I was also able to return the acrylic yarn that I had originally purchased.  The yarn appears quite blue in my photo, but I would describe it as more like teal (not great light here today for photos).</p>

<p>I won't go on about my book this week.  Still on The Lacuna.  I don't think I have ever taken so long to read a book before!</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what everyone has been knitting this week.  Jacinta x</p>
