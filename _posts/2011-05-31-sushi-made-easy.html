<p>We all love sushi and to buy the quantity we eat in a sitting is astronomical (Scarlett just about eats her body weight in sushi!), hence I make it as opposed to buying it (although it is what my kids ask for if we are out and they need lunch).  Tuna filling seems to favoured by the kids and Greg, but you can use what ever ingredients you like.  Make sure you don't overfill and don't use anything too moist, or you will be wearing more sushi than you will be eating.  You don't need a bamboo sushi roller either, the secret to that is how you prepare the cooked rice.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>1 cup = 250ml</p>
<p>3 cups sushi rice<br />
1 packet nori sheets, or approximately 10 nori sheets<br />
1 425gm tin tuna, drained (I prefer tuna in olive oil)<br />
1/4 cup whole egg mayonaise<br />
1 avocado<br />
2 tbsp rice wine vinegar (can substitute with ordinary vinegar)<br />
1tsp salt<br />
1 1/2 tbsp castor sugar</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Rinse rice in a sieve, till the water runs clear.  Cook rice according to your favourite method.  (I use a rice cooker).  While rice is cooking, place drained tuna and mayonaise in a food processor and blend until just combined.  Place it aside.  Once rice is cooked, stir in the vinegar, sugar &amp; salt.  Spread the rice on a large plate to a thickness of about 2.5 cm (1").  Put in fridge for about 10-15 mins to cool the rice down.  Remove rice from fridge and cut it into strips about 3cm (1.5") wide (this is what makes rolling them later on so much easier).</p>

<p>Place a nori sheet on a clean surface and cut off a strip of the rice to fit the width of the nori sheet.  Place the rice about a quarter of the way along the nori sheet.</p>

<p>Spread a layer of tuna on top of the rice and add strips of avocado.   Roll the first quarter of the nori sheet around the rice and press gently into place.  Keep rolling until the nori sheet is totally wrapped around the rice and filling.</p>

<p>Repeat until you have used up all the rice.  Cut the rolls into your preferred size before serving.  I make a dip of equal amounts of lemon juice and tamari sauce (or soya sauce) and add few drops of sesame oil and garnish of coriander (cilantro).</p>
