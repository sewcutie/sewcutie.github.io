<p>I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning making sure a certain princess had her fair share of mattress to sleep on.  I must say that I think I want her has my Christmas gift.  This is a pattern out of More soft toys.  I was intending it for Scarlett but I sense that it may have to be a combined gift for Tenneille as well, as I know it may cause issues if it belonged to just one of the girls.</p>
