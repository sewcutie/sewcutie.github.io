<p>Our dear Scarlett turned nine this week.  She is the kind of girl that can't wait to grow up, but still retains a sweet innocence that I hope will linger for a few years yet.  Her only present request was for a porcelain doll, how could I not grant that! In fact, she ended up with two as my mum got her one also.  Scarlett was so excited and has lovingly tucked them up every night since, in her doll's cradle beside her bed.  It's so very sweet.</p>

<p>To top off her birthday, she also had a class party.  I swore after the last class party a couple of years ago, I'd never do it again, although I wizened up this time and had the party at a park.  The reason for my lapse in sanity (for holding such a party), was due to the fact we decided to pull Scarlett from her current school, so felt it was a lovely way to have closure after nearly six years with the same kids, starting in playgroup.  There were tears from me as we were presented with a gorgeous needle felted picture that each family contributed their own piece of artwork to.  I'd held it together quite well, up till that point.</p>
<p>Scarlett will be attending the same school as Tenneille from next term.  It will mean over an hour less travelling each day, thus we will have more quality family time during the week and as we all know that is too precious not to strive for.  I am looking forward to this new adventure and Scarlett seems pretty happy too.  She had a trial day at the new school and has already made a couple of friends.</p>
<p>So dear Scarlett, wishing you the sweetest of birthdays and may this year bring you many wonderful new adventures to carry in your heart in the years to come.</p>
