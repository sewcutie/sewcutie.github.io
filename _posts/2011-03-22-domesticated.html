<p>I was in the kitchen preparing a meal the other day and noticed that Jairah was being oh so quiet.  I took a peak around the corner of the door to discover Jairah busily ironing (the iron was unplugged).  I quickly grabbed the camera to get some photo evidence.  He was very proud of his efforts.  Especially when he discovered that water came out of the iron if you tipped it up. I honestly never knew ironing could be so much fun.  Oh, and that scrunched up fabric in the background on the table (second photo down)?  Well that was <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=411">Scarlett's birthday quilt</a> all laid out nicely, ready for my next step towards finishing the top.  Oh, hum, guess I shouldn't complain with the help I was getting in the meantime.</p>
