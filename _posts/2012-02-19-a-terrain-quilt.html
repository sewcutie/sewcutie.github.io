<p>I have been busy the last couple of days trying to get a quilt finished for a dear friend who turned 40 this week.  Her party was last night, but I didn't quite get the quilt finished in time.  But alas today, it is done.  She loves purple and it seemed the Kate Spain Terrain charm packs I had stashed away had been waiting for just the right person, with it's lovely mix of purples and complimentary colours.  Teamed with the solid purple (Bella solid Terrain Iris, by Moda), I am happy with how it has come together.</p>
<p>The design is my own, using two packs of charm squares and about 3 metres of the Bella Iris solid fabric.  Unfortunately the lighting wasn't the best tonight and the purple is really hard to capture correctly.  Of course the pictures I took showing the whole of the front and back turned out terribly, so will have to add some more pictures tomorrow.</p>

<p>Her party was so much fun and I managed to catch up with lots of lovely people who I don't get to see often.  We were entertain with beautiful singing and music being played by her talented friends.  Although, I must admit my late night has caught up with me tonight. I can hardly keep my eyes open.  I hope you have had a beautiful weekend?  Jacinta x</p>
