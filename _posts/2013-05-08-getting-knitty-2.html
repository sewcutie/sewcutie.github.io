<p>It seems May triggers my inner knitter and I get itching to start new projects for the coming winter months.  I finished a <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1912">Sweet Memories Cowl</a> for a friend recently using leftover Zara Chiné yarn.  She lives overseas and her birthday was months ago.  It took me forever to knit the last few rows, due to getting the house ready for market.  Now we are playing the waiting-for-a-buyer game, knitting will hopefully help me keep the last remainder of my sanity!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I cast on another Sweet Memories Cowl, this time for myself.  I was tossing up between knitting with some Noro Silk Garden Lite in green/blue and brown shades or some mid grey Alpaca yarn I bought while we were away at Easter (something else I haven't gotten around to blogging about!).  I decided to go with the alpaca yarn.  The yarn was purchased in Beechworth at The Ardent Alpaca (lovely shop and staff).  It's made in Australia by Tailored Strands and is 8ply.  It has a lovely soft feel to it.  I am determined to finish this one for my birthday, which of course is this coming Sunday!</p>

<p>I think I want to knit another <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1869">Tea Leaves cardi</a> this winter too.  I also love <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/tilted-duster">this</a> pattern.  Jairah needs a new jumper/sweater this winter too, not sure what though.  Any suggestions for a boys pattern in size 4/5 would be appreciated.</p>
