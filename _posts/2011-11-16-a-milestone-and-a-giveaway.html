<p>So it seems this blog has made it's first trip around the sun.  I have enjoy my blogging journey thus far.  My favourite part though, has been 'meeting' all you beautiful bloggers out there, who I'd otherwise never have connected with.  I love visting your blogs and seeing what you have all been up to.  Thank you to all those who visit here and your lovely comments.  It's what inspires me to keep at it.</p>
<p>Now for the giveaway!  It seems that Christmas is just around the corner and what better item to offer than a Christmas stocking made by yours truly. (I made one each for my kids <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=280">last year</a> and they loved them).<br />
This giveaway is open to ALL.  Feel free to let others know about this giveaway.  The more the merrier.  Good luck and I will draw the winner Monday 21 November (in Australia).</p>

<p>Please ensure I can contact you, should you win, as I will need to post out the Christmas stocking ASAP so you will hopefully receive it before Christmas.</p>
