<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/06/yarn-along_15.html">Ginny at Small Things </a>yarn along this week.</p>
<p>Now I have finished <a href=" http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=986 ">Scarlett's dress</a>, I have cast on a jumper/sweater for Jairah.  The yarn is by Cleckheaton and is deep green with a slight fleck through it.  The pattern is out of a book probably fromt he early 80's.</p>

<p>I have just started reading The Secret Holocaust Diaries by Nonna Bannister on Kindle (hence no photo as I used my phone to take the picture).  I am only a few pages in, so have no opinion as yet.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what everyone is up to.  Jacinta x</p>
