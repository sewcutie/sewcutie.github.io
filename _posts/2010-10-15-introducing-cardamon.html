<p>So I though I would introduce you to the fuzzy member of our family - Cardamon, aka, Cardamon Bear, our toy poodle.  He is gorgeous, cheeky, mischievous and very much loved.  Scarlett treats him like a doll, Tenneille is, well, really cheeky with him and Jairah loves him in a very gentle way.  Cardamon follows me all over the house and when I stop he stops at my heels.  He's one very devoted dog!</p>
<p>We call him the cat-dog, as he has funny little traits that are quite cat-like.  That is he plays like a cat, pouncing on toys, flies (yes, he loooves chasing flies and playing with them till they are no longer living), any bugs really and he loves to snuggle up on your lap or next to you in the evening.  Of course he is a fussy eater and the only dog food he willingly eats is, of course, made of fish and smells like typical cat food.  He even makes a funny noise sometimes which sounds so much like a meow!</p>
<p>I love the fact he doesn't shed fur.  That is a big factor as he is an indoor dog.  Oh and his fur is so soft and silky.  I bet it would knit up into the softest of wool.  It would be even softer than alpaca and not at all scratchy!!</p>
<p>Our main reason for getting a dog was to help Scarlett get over her fear of dogs.  Whenever she saw a dog, even across the other side of the road, she would leap into your arms.  I often I had Jairah in a sling so she would basically land on top of him and a couple of times she actually knocked me over.  Yes, it was an extreme fear!  Albiet to say, she is now great with dogs and keeps saying she wants another (sorry love, but no!).</p>
<p>We have been really firm with him when it comes to jumping up on people.  He knows he isn't allowed to do it, especially with us, but it only takes one person who lets him jump up on them and then he makes a complete fool out of himself.  But to his credit, last week when I took him to Scarlett's school he didn't jump on any of the kids, but there was a parent there who, you guessed it, let him jump all over her. As soon as I asked her to tell him to sit, he did.  Now all I have to do is train the adults!!</p>
