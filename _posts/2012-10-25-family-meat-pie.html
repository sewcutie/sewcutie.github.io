<p>Ah yes, the iconic Aussie meat pie.  While I admit I like pies, there are very few bakeries that can make one that is really good.  We are lucky enough to have a few bakeries locally that make a good pie, but I often wonder what is really in them.  I decided to try my hand at making one that the kids would all eat.  I'm happy to say, they all enjoyed it, in fact, Jairah, who often doesn't eat dinner, asked for seconds.  That is a successful meal in my opinion.  Thankfully I remembered to write down what I added as I went along.  I'm notorious for making meals and not remembering to write down ingredients or quantities!  The pie reheats nicely the next day too (that is if you have leftovers!) and the flavour seems to go through the meat, just don't reheat in the microwave as the pie will go soggy.  I cheat with the puff pastry and buy ready made, but you could aways try your hand at puff pastry too.  I find making short crust pastry quick and easy if you use a food processor or Thermomix.</p>
<p><strong>Short Crust Pastry Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>1 1/2 c plain flour<br />
100gm butter, diced<br />
3-4 tbspn (approx.) chilled water</p>
<p><strong>Pie Ingredients: </strong></p>
<p>1 kg lean beef mince<br />
2 onions, finely chopped<br />
3 tbsp tomato paste<br />
2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce<br />
2 tbsp cornflour<br />
1 1/2 cup water<br />
stock powder to taste (I use massel's Chicken stock powder)<br />
1tsp oil<br />
salt and pepper if desired</p>
<p>2 sheets pre made puff pastry, thawed</p>
<p>1 egg, beaten</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Place butter and flour in food processor and mix until resembles bread crumbs.  Add water, a little at a time until mixture forms a ball.  Remove from food processor and place covered in fridge for at least 30 mins.<br />
Meanwhile, pour oil in a frypan add onions and cook for a couple of minutes.  Add mince and cook until browned.  Stir in Worcestershire sauce and tomato paste.  Mix the cornflour and stock powder into the water before adding to the mince mixture.  Stir until sauce thickens.<br />
Roll out the pastry until it's about 5mm thick and place in a pie dish approx. 26 cm in diameter.  Trim edges.  Spoon in hot mince mixture.  Brush the pie edge with the beaten egg.  Place the puff pastry on top, trim if needed (I don't as my kids love the extra puff pastry).  Brush with egg and place holes in the pastry top to allow steam to escape during cooking.  Place in a preheated oven @180 degrees celsius for approximately 20-25 mins or until pastry is lovely and golden brown.  Serve with mashed potato and veggies or on its own!  Serves approx. 6-8 people.</p>
