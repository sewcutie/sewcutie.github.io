<p>Reflecting on the flood devastation in Queensland, lives lost and other lives altered for evermore, made me hug my kids more today, for longer and just embrace whatever our day brought.  Australian's have an amazing and generous spirit whenever the country experiences a natural disaster and for that I am proud.  I appreciate the people who are currently doing all that they can to help those affected.  My heart goes out to you all.</p>
<p>May you and yours be safe and well, Jacinta x</p>
