<p>As mentioned in my previous post, I managed to find the perfect button for my Fear Of Commitment Cowl.  The button is glazed and made from coconut with hand painted flowers.  It matches the yarn perfectly.  I think I may have done some sort of giddy happy dance when I happend upon it.  I have already worn the cowl a couple of times and I am sure it will be worn a lot more come winter, seems it's getting really cold now.</p>

<p>The button is looped together with elastic through a toggle button on the opposite side.  It means I can move the button around, depending on how I want to wear the cowl.  I love simple ideas like that.  Jacinta x</p>
