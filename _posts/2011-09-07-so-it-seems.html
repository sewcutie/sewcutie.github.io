<p>..another day has passed and I haven't had a chance to sit down and write a blog post, meaningful or not!  It has been a rather crazy few days.  We are preparing to get our kitchen renovation underway and of course lots of fiddly things are involved in that, yet I am so excited that my 'kak' coloured kitchen will be no longer in about 4 weeks.</p>
<p>We are literally tripping over stuff stored around the house.  Therefore, I have been listing stuff on ebay in a kind of selling frenzy.  There are a few people out there that have bought absolute bargains.  The hardest part is getting them to come quick enough to get the stuff out of the house.  I have a love/hate relationship with ebay to be honest.  Some people you deal with are great, others, well let's just say, um, nothing about them.</p>
<p>On a lovely note, I looked after a good friend of mine's children overnight and this morning myself and all 5 children headed off to the Rhododendron Gardens in Olinda for a frolic amongst the spring blossoms.  It was a beautiful morning and I rather enjoyed playing mother duck attending all her charges.  The kids were very sweet and literally stopped to smell all the blossoms.<br />
It really is a beautiful time of year here.  We are very lucky to live near such beautiful gardens.  If you ever get up to the Dandenong Ranges, you must visit the Rhododendron gardens, I know you will love it.  Blogged <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=217">here</a> also.  It's best to bring kids, because they will make you stop and look at everything and you know that is what life is about, slowing down and taking it all in.  Yes, kids really do know the secret to happiness and I am so glad I got to spend the day with all 5 of them.</p>

<p>On another good note, I just recently realised that I have over 200 blog posts and I think I sense a giveaway coming on.  If I get around to it, I will host a giveaway tomorrow.   Stay tuned!  Love y'all, Jacinta x</p>
