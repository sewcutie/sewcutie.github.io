<p>This is another favourite cafe.  It's not in the hills though.  Blue Dish is a french inspired cafe that serves really good food.  I tend to order their tarts with a salad.  On this visit I ordered a smoked salmon tart and chickpea salad.  The crust on the tart is light, crumbly and tastes oh so buttery!  The salad was perfect.  Their flourless chocolate cake is lovely.  I ordered a toasted bagette for Jairah.  He managed to eat most of it, which was a feat in itself, as the serving was quite large. Coffee is good too, not too bitter.  Blue Dish is located at 326 Highett Road, Highett.</p>
