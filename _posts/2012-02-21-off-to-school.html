<p>Tenneille started school this year. We are into the third week and so far, so good.  She happily gets ready in the morning and is very eager to get to school.  We decided for a myriad of reasons, to send her to a different school to Scarlett.  It certainly adds an interesting angle to the week, but thankfully we are carpooling with another family which makes the logistics of getting children to and from different locations at the same time possible.</p>

<p>Tenneille looks so darn cute in her uniform and I have to giggle whenever she runs ahead of me, at the fact her bag is practically bigger than she is (as is her school dress.  I could fit two of her in it!).</p>

<p>The hardest part so far has been trying to extract Jairah from the classroom.  He certainly likes the school!</p>
