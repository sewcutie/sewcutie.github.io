<p>We are about 2 weeks off having our kitchen delivered.  It will come flat packed and requires <del datetime="2011-09-19T23:56:09+00:00">some</del> a lot of assembly.  We are going through a company called <a href="http://kitsetkitchens.com.au/">Kitset Kitchens</a>.  they have been great to deal with so far.  Here's hoping the end result will be good too.  Greg's dad and wife are coming over from New Zealand to help us get the kitchen sorted.</p>
<p>There is so much to do.  We have to remove the old kitchen, pull up the slate floor, get the plumber and electrician in to do their thing.  Install the cabinets, appliances, flooring and then get the company, <a href="http://granitetransformations.com.au/">Granite Transformations</a>, who are installing our stone bench tops, to come and work their magic.  I am both excited and overwhelmed by all that has to be done.  I need to somehow parent 3 children amongst the chaos.  I know it is going to dramatically change our house and I am looking forward to having an oven again.  I have been without an oven for close to 6 months now and the novelty is wearing a little thin, but I know there is going to be a lovely light, bright new kitchen in my very near future and that will keep me going for now.</p>
<p>One of the features of the kitchen will be a 2 metre long island bench with waterfall edges and will allow us to sit along one edge.  It seems I spend a lot of time in the kitchen (don't we all) and I am excited to think of all the get togethers we will have, where I can be part of the conversations, while everyone gathers around my kitchen bench.<br />
I am so looking forward to having stone bench tops once again.  The style we have chosen is called <a href="http://granitetransformations.com.au/product-range/colour-range">White Star</a> and is light in colour with flecks of mirror through the stone that reflects the light (it isn't tacky, I promise!).  It looks really pretty under halogen lighting.  I would love to show you photos of my dream kitchen but I don't have any and I have tried looking on line, but haven't found anything similar to what we are installing.  So I guess it will be a surprise to you and me both.  I can't wait to share the before and after photos.  I think it will just about flip me out!  Jacinta x</p>
