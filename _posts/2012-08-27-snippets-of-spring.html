<p>It seems spring is starting to weave it's way into our days.  Wattle is bursting out in bloom everywhere, daffodils are popping up, looking so sweet and friendly and the Rhododendrons are looking splendid.  We all went for a walk in the National Rhododendron Gardens in the lovely hills village of Olinda yesterday and spent lots of our time smelling the flowers and searching for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrebird">Lyre birds</a> (hmm, one needs to be pretty quiet to see them, thus we didn't).  I'm hanging out for the cherry tree avenue, that is part of the gardens, to burst into bloom.  Not long now.  We are going back there on Father's Day this coming weekend, as the kids really want to have a picnic there.  Fingers crossed it won't rain.  It's very family friendly and it's free to get in.  A must visit if you find yourself in the Dandenong Ranges (and no, they didn't pay me to say that).</p>

(Greg asked me to tell you that is Tenneille's fluro scarf on his shoulder and not some new fashion trend:)[/caption]</p>
<p>I must admit that I am looking forward to some warmer weather, but I won't hold my breath, as it doesn't really warm up here till November.  Are you noticing changes in the seasons too?</p>
