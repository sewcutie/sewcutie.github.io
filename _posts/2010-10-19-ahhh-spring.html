<p>I really hope I'm not going to jinx the sunshine today posting this??  This past winter has felt long and draw out.  It is always cooler here in the Dandenong Ranges, generally by up to 5 degrees (Celcius) compared to the likes of Melbourne.  We are often in fog, when 5 minutes down the road it can be bright, blue sunny skies, other times we are looking down upon the clouds in the valleys.  Ah, magical!  The weather here is quite unique.</p>
<p>What I love about spring is all the green that is budding, bursting and unfurling around here.  It feels like a promise of good things to come.  The kiss goodbye to winter and the hello to warmer days.</p>
