<p>This recipe is enjoyed by all of us.  I love a recipe that the kids don't complain about eating.  They take a little while to prepare, but are definitely worth it.  The recipe, originally titled Fried Chicken Wings, comes from a favourite book of mine, Little Vietnam by Nhut Huynh.  It has lots of tasty recipes.  I love that it has sauce recipes too.  They taste like the real deal and I must admit, the results put a lot of Asian takeaway to shame.  I have altered the ingredient amounts slightly from the recipe in the book.  The wings can also be served cold or can be reheated the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>2kg chicken wings<br />
1/2 red onion, finely chopped<br />
2 cloves garlic, minced<br />
1/2 tsp white pepper<br />
1/2 tsp Chinese five-spice<br />
2/3 cup fish sauce<br />
2 tbspn white sugar<br />
1 cup plain flour<br />
1 cup rice flour<br />
Oil for frying (I use GM free canola oil)</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Pat chicken wings with paper towel until dry.  Cut wings into two pieces at the joint.  If tips of wings are attached, discard them.   Combine garlic, onion, pepper, five-spice, fish sauce and sugar.  Coat wings with this mixture.  Leave the wings to marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.  You can leave overnight if you wish.</p>
<p>Just before cooking, place wings in a colander over a bowl and allow excess marinade to drain off.  mix the plain flour and the rice flours together.  Add approximately 1/4 cup of the flour to a bowl and add about 1/4 of the chicken wings.  Coat evenly with flour and fry in pre-heated oil, browning on all sides, approximately 7 minutes, or until cooked through.  Repeat this for the remaining chicken wings.  Wings can be placed on paper towel to drain excess oil.  If need be, place wings in the oven to keep warm.</p>
<p><strong>Dipping sauce:</strong></p>
<p>1 cup lemon juice<br />
1 tbsp salt<br />
1 tbsp white pepper</p>
<p>Mix lemon juice, pepper and salt together.  Pour into a small dish for dipping.</p>
