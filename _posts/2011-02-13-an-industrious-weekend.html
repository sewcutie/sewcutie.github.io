<p>We have had a very busy weekend.  Greg worked on our new decking, which is almost finished.  I spent the weekend painting the spare room which will soon become Tenneille's bedroom.  The original paint colour in the house is quite dark, so it takes at least 3 coats to cover.  My arms are feeling my painting efforts. Hope to have some photo's to show you soon.</p>
<p>Time for me to sit down and have a cuppa.  Sadly we have the heater going.  Feels like autumn is starting to kick in.  I checked the chooks aka 'the girls' just before and even they are huddled in one nesting box together tonight.  So much for summer!  Hoping you had a weekend filled with fun and jobs accomplished, or not!  Jacinta x</p>
