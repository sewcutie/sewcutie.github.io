<p>I whipped these up for afternoon tea.  A friend was dropping Scarlett off this afternoon, which means I gained an extra 1 1/2 hours of my afternoon (school is not close by).  I put the time to good use and was able to make these muffins.  They always go down a treat and take no time to prepare.  This recipe is dairy free.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />
Makes approximately 12 muffins</p>
<p>2 bananas, mashed<br />
2 eggs<br />
1 1/2 cup plain (all purpose) flour, white, wholemeal or spelt is fine<br />
1/2 cup oil, I use GM free Canola<br />
1/2 cup raw sugar<br />
1 tsp Bi-carb soda (baking soda)<br />
1 tsp Cream of tartar<br />
1/2 tsp cinammon<br />
1/2 tsp nutmeg</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>In a bowl, whisk the eggs, add sugar and whisk until well combined.  Then add oil and whisk until oil is mixed through.  Stir in the mashed bananas.  Sift the dry ingredients and add to the mix, stirring to combine.  Spoon mix into prepared muffin tins.  Bake for approximately 12-15 mins @ 160 degrees celsius until cooked through.</p>
