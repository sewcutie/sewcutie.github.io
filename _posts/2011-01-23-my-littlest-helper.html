<p>Our sweet little poppet Jairah isn't interested in toys, no, just give him something like a vacuum and he is one happy chap.  He spent about half an hour today taking it apart and putting it back together.  One of his favourite things of all is pulling out the cord and retracting it with his foot, yes, just like mama does!  That's my boy.  Unfortunately it loses its appeal once it is actually turned on.<br />
He is making me think I need a bit of a mind shift when it comes to my vacuum.  Maybe vacuums are fun after all!  Thanks for you enthusiasm dear Jairah.</p>
