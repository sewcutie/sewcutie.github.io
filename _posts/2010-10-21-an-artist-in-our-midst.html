<p>So it seems young Jairah is potentially a Picasso in the making.  While I was distracted in the kitchen, talking to a friend who was visiting, Jairah was busy practicing his artistic skills on our off-white leather sofa.  Needless to say he has done a 'great' job.  He was so very proud of his work to say the least.  What's a mama to do?  I just took the pen and a photo, which he was very happy to pose for I might add!  Scarlett was very impressed that Jairah had actually drawn some 'letters'.</p>
<p>As I type, Greg is busy trying to lift the pen out of the leather.  Oh well, at least it will be really clean once we are finished!!</p>
