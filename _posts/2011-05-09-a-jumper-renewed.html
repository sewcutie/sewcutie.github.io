<p>Tenneille had a favourite owl jumper that we recently gave to a little girl who had been left behind at a playground.  After everyone waited for 2 hours to see if anyone would return to get the girl the police had to be called as it was getting late.</p>
<p>Tenneille was quite distressed that we had given the girl her favourite jumper, so I promised I would make her her very own mama made owl jumper and I explained to her that the little girl was cold and needed her jumper more than she did at the time.  Suffice to say, Tenneille loves her new owl jumper and tells me that is it better than the one she'd had.</p>

<p>It is my own pattern and is made from scraps of material.  I attached the material to double sided 'heat-n-bond' and ironed it onto the jumper.  I did running stitch around the edges and sewed two wooden buttons on for the eyes.  The jumper was purchased from an op-shop, as it seems plain jumpers are hard to come by when trying to shop in a hurry.  (Have I mentioned I love op shops?  Well I do).</p>

<p>As for the little girl, apparently she was picked up from the police station the same evening.  That is all I know.  I must admit I didn't sleep well for many days afterwards.  It was quite distressing for all involved and I only hope the little girl has recovered from her ordeal.</p>
