<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/03/yarn-along_16.html">Ginny at Small Things</a> yarn along this week.</p>
<p>I have finally finished piecing and sewing together the blessingway baby blanket.  It has come together quite well considering all the different sized pieces people had contributed.  I had to knit a couple of small pieces to fill in the gaps.  I think it looks rather like a crazy quilt. I had to be rather creative in sewing it together as some pieces weren't square, but I think it add character to the blanket.<br />
It is currently in the wash and then I will block it to get a neat rectangle.  Hoping it will be given to the family this week.</p>

<p>As for reading.  Sadly I haven't really had time this week.  Although my copy of Little Things To Sew by Oliver + S arrived today.  It has some cute projects that I will tackle in the near future.</p>

<p>Can't wait to see what everyone else is up to.</p>
