<p>It seems this last week, spring has been sending forth her sweet and tender tendrils, hinting of the goodness yet to come.  Blossoms are bursting out, daffodils are covering hillsides in bold colours and the sun feels warm and healing.  I have noticed all the birds returning to our garden and the raucous they make in the mornings is, well, a bit of a din.  One of those birds, the kookaburras are announcing the arrival of first morning light and the sunrises have been turning all that they touch into gold for just a few short minutes before a sky of blue makes a promise of warmer days to come.  I find myself lifting my face to the sun throughout the day and feeling energised.  It seems Spring's tendrils are wrapping themselves around my every being, coaxing me to work the cool earth and plant the promise of a plentiful harvest????  Perhaps this is fleeting and Spring may retract her tendrils a few times before they set, but the season is definitely shifting????</p>
