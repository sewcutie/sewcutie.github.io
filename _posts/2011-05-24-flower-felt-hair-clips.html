<p>As part of Scarlett's birthday party favours, I included some felt hair clips.  I needle felted the centers of the flowers and sewed a clip fastener on the back.  They are a quick and easy project.  You could used what ever shape you want i.e. hearts, butterflies, toadstools, egg (for Easter), whatever your imagination desires.</p>
<p>Materials</p>
<p>Wool felt in desired colour or pre cut felt<br />
Cotton in contrasting colour/s<br />
Hair fasteners/clips<br />
Wool fleece<br />
Felting needle</p>
<p>Instructions for making a flower</p>
<p>Cut out desired shapes from wool felt or use pre cut shapes.  Use a small amount of wool fleece which has been roughly bound into a ball.  Place in centre of flower cutout.  Stab with needle continually to form a rounded mound.  I find it pays to turn the flower as you go to get an even shape.  Once desired size is reached sew the flower onto hair clip using contrasting cotton.  There you have it, one cute clip!</p>
