<p>Well this week started out quite cool.  In fact we lit the fire twice.  Nothing like a fire to add to the ambiance of the festive season.  I decided to get my knitting out, because wood fires provoke that in me, and re-cast a hat that I had frogged a while back.  It isn't a complicated pattern, it's just I, in all my wisdom, took it (the first version) along to a craft night held with a group of friends.  That was a big mistake, as I got talking and stuffed up my knitting.  I am quite the multi tasker, but not when it comes to knitting.  Now I should know this, but every now and again, my ego gets the better of me and I feel the need to knit in company.  Perhaps, if I did make New Year resolutions, at the top of my list would be:<br />
Don't try and talk while knitting, or knit while talking, hmm, we'll see how long it takes me to try that out again (probably not all that long).</p>
<p>Anyway, the hat.   It is called Sideways Grande Hat.  I am using Moda Vera Mousse yarn which is 70% wool, 30% soya.  It's lovely and soft.  The colour I would describe as petrol or perhaps peacock blue. The pattern is from a book called  Boutique Knits by Laura Irwin.  I love this book (a gift from a dear friend) and can see myself knitting quite a few of the patterns.  I'm lovin' the hat on the front cover (Side Slip Cloche).  It will be the next thing to cast on after I have finished the Sideways Grande.</p>
<p>Please feel free to link your latest knitting project.  I always love to see what other people are knitting.</p>
