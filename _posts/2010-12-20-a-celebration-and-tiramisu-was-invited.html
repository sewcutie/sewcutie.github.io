<p>I was invited out last night to celebrate a dear friend's birthday.  The dinner party had an Italian theme, which we all contributed a dish to.  My contribution, Tiramisu.  Of course, I made a double batch so I could have a try (ahem, well, ok Greg wanted to have a try too).  We were told no presents, but I felt a block of Green &amp; Blacks organic chocolate was in order, I mean who could say no to G&amp;B's.</p>

<p><strong>Here is the Tiramisu recipe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>3 eggs, separated<br />
4 tbsp sugar (I use raw sugar)<br />
1 cup strong black coffee, cold<br />
250gm mascarpone cheese<br />
200gm sponge fingers<br />
4 tbsps (optional) liquor of your choice (I used Amarula which is a creamy liquor) - Traditionally you can use Marsala or Vermouth if desired.<br />
unsweetened cocoa<br />
pinch of salt</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Place egg whites and egg yolks in separate bowls.  Place sugar in bowl with egg yolks.  Beat until thick and creamy.  Next, add mascarpone, a spoonful at a time, until blended.  Set aside.  Whisk egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form.  Gently add beaten egg whites to the mascarpone mixture.  Stir until just combined.</p>
<p>In a dish pour in coffee and liquor.  Dip each side of sponge fingers quickly in coffee and arrange in bottom of a shallow dish.  Add half of the mascarpone mixture.  Repeat another layer of sponge fingers that have been dipped in the coffee mix.  Add the rest of the mascarpone mixture and smooth over. Dust the top with cocoa powder using a sieve.  Place in the fridge for at least 2 hours or preferably overnight, to allow the flavours to infuse.</p>
