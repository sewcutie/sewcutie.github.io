<p>Well to say it rained is an understatement.   We had about 140mm of rain over Friday night and Saturday with monsoon type weather descending on these parts.  We had to go down the mountain to a birthday party yesterday which turned into a bit of an adventure as most of the roads were blocked.  Roads resembled rivers.  Plenty of people were pulled up on the side of the road taking photos of water.  I have no photos to show as I felt I would be contradicting myself after all the ranting I did while trying to drive around people's cars that were poorly parked on the side of the road and don't let me go on about one driver that tried very hard, but thankfully wasn't successful, in trying to cause an accident.</p>
<p>We were without power for almost a day and a half.  We currently have our heater going.  Thought about lighting to wood fire, but all the kindling is wet!  Summer huh?  The frog that lives outside our bedroom is happy though.  It's quite sweet being serenaded to sleep by it's croaking (I'm serious, I love frogs).  We are safe and well and at the end of the day, that is what matters.  Hoping you spent your weekend high and dry.</p>
