<p>In my absence from this space, I did get a little knitting time in.  I had some gorgeous yarn in my stash that was the perfect colour for Tenneille. I wrote the pattern as I knitted it.  It's the perfect child's size and could even be fine for an adult if you don't want a bulky cowl.  The yarn is Sheppard """. It uses about 50gm of yarn. The skein had enough to make a beret too.  I used the Raspberry beret pattern from Ravelry and just adjusted the pattern to fit.</p>
