<p><em>- Keepin' It Real captures the true essence of family life that I know are fleeting, keeping this mama grounded -</em></p>
<p>It's been a little quiet around here of late, as everyone, except Tenneille has had some sort of winter lurgy.  We all seem to be mostly well, but I feel I am dragging my feet today.  So much to catch up on from the last two weeks, where I have felt it was more important to slow down and spend time cuddling unwell children.  Of course the kids play room has literally been turned upside down.  It is next on my list of things to get through, after the next load of washing is put in the washing machine.  On the up side, Greg and I are going out tonight to celebrate a good friend's 40th birthday.  I am looking forward to this rare night off.  I bought a new dress</p>
