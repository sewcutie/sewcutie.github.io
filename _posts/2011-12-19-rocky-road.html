<p>There are so many variations of Rocky Road, this is my recipe.  I tend to make a few extra yummy treats around Christmas to give as gifts.  This being one of them.  Greg and I tucked into a piece each tonight.  Hopefully we'll leave some for gift giving!  I use raspberry liquorice instead of turkish delight and add a couple of other goodies like chocolate coated blueberries and scorch almonds to add flavour and interest.  I recommend using a silicon dish or lining your dish with baking paper to help when cutting up the rocky road, otherwise it will stick to the dish and make it hard to remove.  I bet you can't stop a just one piece!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>200gm block dark or milk chocolate<br />
150gm (approx. 2/3 cup) scorch almonds<br />
70gm (approx. 1/3 cup) dark chocolate covered blueberries, or dried blueberries*<br />
120gm (approx. 1/2) Raspberry liquorice, cut into small pieces<br />
125gm (approx. 2/3) Marshmallows (I only use Pascal's brand), cut in half<br />
2 tbspn desiccated coconut</p>
<p>*If  you can't source dried chocolate coated blueberries, you can always substitute with fruit and nut coated chocolate if desired.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Using a double saucepan, melt chocolate over a gentle heat. In the meantime, combine, scorch almonds, choc coated blueberries, raspberry liquorice, and marshmallows in a bowl.  Once chocolate has melted, remove from heat and pour it over the other ingredients.  Gently stir ingredients together and pour the rocky road mix into a dish. Sprinkle with desiccated coconut and place in fridge until set.  When set, use a knife to break the rocky road into bite size pieces.  Will keep well for a few days in an air tight container or in the fridge in warmer weather.</p>
