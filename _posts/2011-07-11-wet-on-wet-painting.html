<p>I though I'd share the little that I know about wet on wet painting.  As the name suggests you paint with watercolours onto paper that is saturated in water.  The effects can be quite beautiful and is a method used in Steiner/Waldorf education.  I buy the paint in a concentrated form.  The brand is Stockmar.  You mix a small amount into some water that has been boiled or is distilled to avoid unwanted mould growth if storing the paints.  I use about 1/2 a teaspoon to a small pot of water.  The jars I use are specifically for storing the paints, but you can use baby food jars or any glass jar with a fitted lid.  I add the water first then the paint.  Mix together (I use either a chopstick or a skewer) and it is ready to use.  I have stuck to the primary colours, red, blue and yellow.  I remember Scarlett's kinder teacher telling the children to keep the paints looking like jewels to help avoid the colours being mixed.  I thought that was a very sweet reminder.  I use budget sheets of paper purchased from a Steiner/Waldorf craft shop.  I believe you could use butcher type paper that comes in the big rolls often available at craft stores or the likes of Ikea.  You need something that will absorb the water but won't fall apart too easily.  Although it is best not to over paint on the paper or you will end up with holes!</p>
<p>Soak the paper until well saturated.  Transfer the paper onto the like of a chopping board or any surface that is waterproof.  I always place a sheet underneath as well, to prevent wayward paint.  I am not fussy about what paint brush is used, as long as the bristle aren't too stiff, otherwise you will be risking digging holes in the paper.</p>
<p>As for what to paint.  That is up to your imagination.  I find this kind of painting very therapeutic and tend paint with fluid movements.  I don't claim to be an artist by any</p>
