<p>I love how simple items around the house have many varied uses for children.  That item at the moment is a plastic tub.  Jairah uses it as his <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=720">bath tub</a>, but it also serves as a comfy place to read books or to play with trains.  He thinks it's wonderful if he gets pushed around in it too!  The tub gets a good work out by the girls as well, and it can become quite the <del datetime="2011-05-01T08:59:22+00:00">fought over</del> wanted item in the playroom.</p>

<p>Of course he loves the car, but obviously that isn't the safest place for him to play.</p>

<p>I love how my children find fun in simple ways that keep them entertained for long periods of time.  What items do you find your children use to entertain themselves?</p>
