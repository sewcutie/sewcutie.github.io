<p>We are certainly in the depths of winter here and the fog didn't lifted all day, therefore I declared that hot chocolate was in order.  I must say this is a heart warming recipe and certainly acts as a pick-me-up on a cold, wet and grey day.  I suggest you use the best quality cocoa and chocolate that you can afford, as that is what makes a hot chocolate <em>really</em> good.  Scooping out some melted chocolate from the bottom of your cup, divine.</p>
<p>If you aren't a fan of chilli, you don't need to add it, although the amount I add is barely detectable.  As for the spices, you can add your favourite if you want.  My choice is merely a serving suggestion.   I grate nutmeg from the whole nut.  It has a stronger aroma and flavour than the powdered form.</p>
<p><em><strong>Winter Warmer Hot Chocolate</strong></em></p>
<p>Ingredients to serve 4:</p>
<p>4 cups (1 litre) soy milk<br />
8-10 tsp good quality cocoa (I use Green &amp; Blacks 70% cocoa)<br />
4 tsp honey<br />
1/4 tsp of mixed spice<br />
1/4 tsp of grated nutmeg<br />
small pinch of chilli powder<br />
8 pieces of good quality milk or dark chocolate (I use Green &amp; Blacks)<br />
Marshmallows to taste</p>
<p><em><strong>Method:</strong></em></p>
<p>With a little of the milk, make a paste with the cocoa (to avoid lumps), then add it to a pot with the rest of the milk, cocoa, honey and spices and heat until very warm, but not boiling.  Add a couple of pieces of good quality chocolate to the bottom of each cup and pour over hot chocolate.  Add marshmallows if desired.</p>
<p><em><strong>Alternatives: </strong></em></p>
<p>You can use cow's milk in lieu of soy.<br />
Add your own favourite spices.<br />
Substitute the honey for maple syrup, agave syrup or sugar if desired.</p>

<p>Scoop, stir and sip your way to pure indulgence.  Enjoy!  Jacinta x</p>
