<p>It's been a typically busy day with a couple of fun extras thrown in.  I went to make our bed this afternoon (yes, it took me most of the day to get to that) to discover toothpaste smeared across the sheets.  I had rescued the toothpaste from Jairah some hours earlier, but thought smugly to myself that I had retrieved it before any mess was made, how wrong was I!  At least we have lovely clean sheets to tuck ourselves under tonight and one less job for the weekend I suppose.</p>
<p>I put a load of washing on before reading the kids their book tonight before bed.  Midway through the book, I could hear a slight clunking noise.  Figured it must be something like a zipper hitting against the side of the washing machine.  Thought nothing more of it until I came out from tucking the girls into bed and the noise omitting from the laundry was now quite loud.  Went in to investigate, looked through the front of the washing machine and there against the glass, tumbling around with the clothes was a paint brush.  I had found Jairah in the laundry an hour or so before and asked him to come out.  What I didn't realise is, he had so helpfully placed the paint brush in the washing machine for me.  To top it off, the paint brush had paint on it.  I had been painting earlier and had wrapped the brush in plastic wrap to prevent the paint drying in between coats. Haven't checked the clothes, as the cycle is still going and of course being a front loader, I can't open it to get the brush out.  I am assuming the clothes will be ok, as the paint is water based.  That will teach me to assume there is nothing in the washing machine before throwing a load on.  Oh, there really is never a dull moment around here.</p>
<p>Now if only I had a photo of Tenneille asleep on our bedroom floor today.  Priceless!</p>
