<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/">Ginny</a> from Small Things.</p>
<p>I am currently knitting my Tea Leaves cardi.  I am loving the pattern and how nicely it is knitting up.  I am loving the 200gm balls of wool (Bendigo Woollen mills luxury 10 ply).  I'm still on my first ball and almost up to dividing for the sleeves.  I am heading up to my mum's for a few days, so I am hoping to factor in some serious knitting time.</p>

<p>I haven't read anything at all this week, as all my spare time has been spent knitting.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing what you have all been up to this week.  Jacinta x</p>
