<p>Now you could be mistaken that this post was going to be about Jairah, but alas Tenneille had her first haircut the other day at 5 1/2 years old.  Tenneille didn't really start growing hair until she was around 2 and it was so fair and fine you could hardly see it.  She was very excited about the prospect of a haircut after watching me trim Scarlett's hair. Although I forgot to take before photos!</p>
<p>Of course this mama gets quite sentimental about first hair cuts (amongst many other things), but then again, I think I have gotten my sentiments worth out of Tenneille's first curls, seems they were over 5 years in the making.  I couldn't help myself and felt a walk down memory lane was in order to see how this gorgeous girl of ours has changed along with her hair, over the last few years.  So here goes...</p>
