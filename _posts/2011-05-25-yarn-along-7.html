<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/05/yarn-along_25.html">Ginny at Small Things </a>yarn along this week.</p>
<p>Oh, my this will be my third post today.  That's a first and promise there has been no caffeine involved!  I am a little further along with Scarlett's dress.  Jairah very kindly pulled it off the needles this morning.  thankfully I was able to get it back on the needles without having to rip it back far.  Silly me for not putting my knitting away last night.  He was very happily tapping the needles together (well they do make a nice sound!).</p>

<p>I have given myself a break from The Lacuna.  A magazine I subscribe to, Australian Smocking and Embroidery arrived in the mail, so I am considering that my reading material for the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what everyone has been up to this week.  I have a little <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=905">giveaway</a> going too if you want to check it out.</p>
