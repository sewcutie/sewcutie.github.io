<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/04/yarn-along-73.html">Ginny at Small Things</a> for yarn along this week.</p>
<p>Well I'm sad to say I haven't come a long way with my lace beret as yet.  I had to pull it out twice, once because I cast on on with the bigger size needles and didn't realise until I went to size up!  The other time I dropped stitches that couldn't be revived.  Throw in a holiday too and well, you get the picture.</p>

<p>Hopefully I will have more to sure next week.  As for books, I've read a couple of books that followed on from Jacob's Daughter by Samantha Jillian Bayarr.  The second book in the series is Called Amish Winter Wonderland and the third book is called Unter The Mulberry Tree.  Although the books were fairly short, the story lines were quite sweet.  Best of all they were cheapies on Kindle.  I tend to only read Kindle books (on my phone) these days.  It's the only way I seem to be able to get a book finished.</p>
<p>I can't wait to see what you have all been crafting and I am always on the look out for new books to read.  Jacinta x</p>
