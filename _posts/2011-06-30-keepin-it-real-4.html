<p><em>- Keepin' It Real captures the true essence of family life that I know are fleeting, keeping this mama grounded -</em></p>

<p>Jairah has the funkiest hair.  It is so fine and whispy, that it often stands on end or has the beginnings of dreadlocks.  But of course he doesn't at all mind.  He loves to pose for a photo, bed hair and all.</p>

<p>I will admit now, that some days it doesn't get brushed and looks like this all-day-long.  It certainly doesn't bother him and well, I think it kind of sums him up very well.  I can't say I look that good on my bad hair days though!  Jacinta x</p>
