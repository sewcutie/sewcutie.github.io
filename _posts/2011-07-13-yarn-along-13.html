<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/07/yarn-along.html">Ginny at Small Things </a>yarn along this week.</p>
<p>I have finished the front and back of Jairah's jumper and have started one of the sleeves.  I thought I would have had the jumper finished by now especially with all the wintery weather we have had, but no, it seems not.  At least I have the fire going tonight, so I might get that sleeve finished.</p>

<p>I have read a little more of my kindle book, Letters of a Woman Homesteader, by Elinore Pruitt Stewart.  It's ok, but I find the constant apologies in the letters a little grating and distract me from the rest of the content.  I'm sure it is a refection on the era the book is based, but it still gets me.  I need a book to read that is all engrossing and the type you don't want to put down.  I was thinking of purchasing the kindle version of the White Queen by Philippa Gregory.  Has anyone read it?</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what you have all been creating and reading this week. Jacinta x</p>
