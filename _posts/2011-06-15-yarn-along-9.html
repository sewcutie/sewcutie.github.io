<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/06/yarn-along_15.html">Ginny at Small Things </a>yarn along this week.</p>
<p>It seems that after miles upon miles of knitting, I am almost finished Scarlett's dress.  I had hoped to have had it finished by today, but I kept stuffing up the pockets of all things (note to self, don't try and knit late at night) and of course I was one ball short so had to go to Spotlight, which is dangerous in itself as I walked out with more than one ball of yarn.  I just need to sew up the seams and finish the neck band.  I haven't had a chance to pick up a book this week.</p>

<p>Can't wait to see what everyone else has been up to this week.  Jacinta x</p>
