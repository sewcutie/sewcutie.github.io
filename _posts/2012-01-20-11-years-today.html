<p>Greg and I are celebrating our 11th wedding anniversary today.  We have planned to go out to dinner tonight thanks to the generosity of a dear friend who is babysitting for us.  It is such a rare treat for just the two of us to go out together.  Best of all, we are heading to a restaurant that is within walking distance (kind of funny, seems we are out of town).  It will be our first time there, so hoping it is good.</p>
<p>I sure do love my man and as mushy as it sounds, more so than the day we met.  Here's hoping for many more years together my dear!  I love <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjFaenf1T-Y">this song</a> and it feels appropriate to share with you all.</p>
<p>Jacinta xx</p>
