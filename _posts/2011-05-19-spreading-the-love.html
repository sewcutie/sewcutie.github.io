<p>The lovely MJ from <a href="http://www.wanderwonderdiscover.com/">Wander Wonder Discover</a> recently nominated my blog for an award.  I am honoured and feel so privileged to have people take interest in my blog.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="assets/versatile_blogger.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here is what needs to happen to continue the versatile blog love along:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Link back and thank the award giver</li>
<li>Share 7 things about yourself</li>
<li>Choose 7 bloggers to pass this award on to</li>
<li>Contact and congratulate the 7 award winners</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>7 things about me:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I studied Traditional Chinese Medicine - Acupuncture, but didn't finish.</li>
<li>I love travelling, and feel I may be part gypsy.</li>
<li>We have grand plans for our family after the end of next year.  May entail overseas travel/living.</li>
<li>I can never craft enough.</li>
<li>I am quite emotional and if you cry, so do I.</li>
<li>I find clowns scary, not at all funny.</li>
<li>I could gaze at babies all day long.  I have always felt 'motherly' and after becoming a mama, felt I had found my life's purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>So now for the 7 blogs I have chosen.  Please note that there are many blogs out there I love and the order I have listed the 7 is random.  If you aren't here, it's not 'cause I don't love you.</p>
