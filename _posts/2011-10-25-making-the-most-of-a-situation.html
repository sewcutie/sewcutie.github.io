<p>I love the places I find Jairah.  He is very good at hiding in funny locations.  This morning he was curled up, complete with a towel for a blankie in the pantry, making the most of the doorless situation.  I just smiled and it reminds me to not feel too perturbed about the kitchen being incomplete.   A friendly reminder in patience too I expect.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, he is sweetness and light.</p>
<p>I hope you too are able to see the lighter side of a situation that would otherwise be frustration.  Jacinta x</p>
