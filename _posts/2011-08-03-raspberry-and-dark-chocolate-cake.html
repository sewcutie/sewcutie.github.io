<p>Well to say the least, this week has been rather full on.  With two sick kids, my to do list which has grown to epic proportions, including trying to get my kitchen renovation off to a start amongst other things, had to be put on hold.  Enter the fact that I have been without my oven for over three months now (it died without warning), my need for something sweet and home baked had reached crisis level.  Enter dad's turbo oven (it's like a bench top convection oven), he has loaned us.  Thanks dad!</p>
<p>I had raspberries in the freezer and dark chocolate in the cupboard and my need for cake, straight out of the oven, was necessary for me to survive another day in sickieville!  I made the recipe up as I went and two slices in, I can say it was a success.  The kids had some too.  I don't think they could believe their luck, as I don't often let them have anything with white sugar let alone chocolate (besides birthday cakes).  Suffice to say, they loved it! My first piece happened to have a huge chunk of melted chocolate in the middle and mixed with the tart flavour of the raspberries, I think I may have bitten into heaven itself.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>1 cup raspberries (I used frozen)<br />
100 gm quality dark chocolate, coarsely chopped<br />
1/2 cup castor sugar<br />
1 cup plain flour<br />
1 cup milk<br />
1 egg<br />
1 small lemon, juiced<br />
rind of one lemon<br />
3 tbsp oil (I use GM free canola oil)<br />
1/2 tsp baking powder (bi-carb soda)<br />
1 tsp cream of tartar</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>First make buttermilk by adding the juice of a lemon to the milk.  Stir and set aside.   Place raspberries in a bowl and sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons of the castor sugar and set aside.</p>
<p>Crack the egg into a mixing bowl and beat until light and fluffy.  Add oil and 1/4 cup of castor sugar and beat until well combined.  Stir in lemon rind and buttermilk.  Sift flour, baking powder, cream of tartar and remaining sugar.  Add to the wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Stir in raspberries and coarsely chopped chocolate.<br />
Pour mixture into a greased cake tin and place in a pre-heated moderate oven for approx. 40 mins or until cooked through.  (Using the turbo oven I cooked the cake at 200 degrees celsius for around 55 mins, but this will vary according to your oven).  Remove from oven and let cool slightly before cutting.   Cut a wedge (or two) and serve with extra berries, dusted with icing sugar or whipped cream if desired.</p>
