<p>I can't believe I have been so absent from my blog.  If you are reading this, "hello!", I've missed you so.  Things have been rather crazy around here of late.  Have some pretty big news to share, but I will have to keep you in suspense just a little longer.  I haven't had much time to go and read my favourite blogs either, so will be rectifying that this week.  As for life in general, things are pretty good.  The girls are loving being back in school and have settled back into our weekly routine.  We have had a really beautiful summer with lots of warm weather and lots of trips to the beach.  The girls were lucky enough to be taken away for a holiday with good friends of our to their family beach house.  They had a wonderful time and I was about to head down for a short stay too.</p>
<p>I'll be back soon to keep you up to date with the craziness that is our life.</p>
