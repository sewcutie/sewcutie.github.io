<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/06/yarn-along-83.html">Ginny</a> from Small Things.</p>
<p>I won't bore you with another 'in progress' of my Tea Leaves tonight, partly because the lighting is non existent and also because I haven't gotten much done this past week.  I have started one of the sleeves, but I am not far into it yet.  A good friend of mine had a baby last week, a little boy.  He is so gorgeous and I am feeling a little sad that this is the first of all her babies (he is the 4th) that I won't get to cuddle for a while.  They live overseas now and I have decided I want to knit him a <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/beyond-puerperium">Beyond Puerperium</a>.  I ordered the yarn today from Bendigo Woollen Mills.  I have sample cards for all their yarn and it was nearly impossible to choose what colour and type of yarn I wanted.  I ended up ordering two different colours, as I couldn't decide between a lovely green called Elm and a grey/blue colour called Lake.  Tough call, I know.</p>
<p>As for reading, I finally finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Keeper-People-Book-One-ebook/dp/B0055HYNH4">Keeper of the People</a>.  It's based on a small tribe of people who come together in adversity.  They are trying to escape with their lives from a cruel warrior and his band.  Of course the story has ended with a cliff hanger you might say, so if I want to find out how the story goes, I need to buy the next book in the series.  While I didn't dislike the book, I found I was skipping over a lot of the wording to get to the storyline.  It waffled on a little, but thankfully I still liked it.  I might read something else in the meantime, before I commit to the next book in the series though.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing your lovely creations and find out what good books I can add to my 'to read' list, as it needs a top up.  Jacinta x</p>
