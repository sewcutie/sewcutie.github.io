<p>We have been buying beautiful bunches of fresh basil in our weekly organic order.  It's fragrance is divine.  I love making pesto this time of year while basil is at it's peak.  The following recipe doesn't last very long around these parts as we can't stop eating it.  Can be served with so many dishes, on pizza, with meat, veggies or as a dip.  Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>2 bunches fresh basil<br />
1/3 cup parmesan cheese, grated<br />
2 cloves fresh garlic<br />
1/3 cup macadamia nuts, lightly toasted<br />
1/3 cup oil (I use half olive oil, half rice bran oil)<br />
salt to taste</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Place all ingredients in food processor except oil.  Blend until well combined.  Pour oil into the mix in a steady stream while food processor is going until combined.  Pour into a prepared jar. Before sealing the jar, place a piece of plastic wrap over the surface to help avoid discolouration.<br />
Store in fridge.  Can be frozen.  I find the best way to do this is to put the pesto in sealable ice cube trays.  This makes perfect size portons for adding to your dishes.</p>
