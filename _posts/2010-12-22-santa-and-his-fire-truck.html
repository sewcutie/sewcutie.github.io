<p>Oh yes, it's custom around these parts for Santa to travel by fire truck to deliver all sorts of sweet things to children.  You can't miss him.  They have the siren going, it's just a guessing game as to where he might be as the sound carries in all directions in the hills.  We missed him last year, but we were on the ball this year.  Jairah was very excited when he heard the siren.  Scarlett hid behind me.  I find bright red Santa's kind of scary, so I wasn't suprised!  Not the best photo's but you will get the idea.</p>
