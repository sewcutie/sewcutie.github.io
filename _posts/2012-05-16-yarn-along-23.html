<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/05/yarn-along-77.html">Ginny</a> from Small Things.</p>
<p>I am happy to say I have finished the cowl from last week and posted about it <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1681">here</a>.  Over the weekend I managed to cast on and finish a Raspberry Beret.  It was a quick knit.  The pattern was easy to follow and the beret is very cute.  However, the yarn I used wasn't 10 ply like I had originally thought, but more like 12ply.  I used smaller needles that the pattern called for, as I had intended the beret for either Scarlett or Tenneille, but it fits me!  May try it again with some 8 ply yarn and see if I can get the right size for the girls.  The pattern is free and can be found on <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/raspberry-beret-2">Ravelry</a>.  The photos don't really do it justice, it looks better on, but I couldn't get a good picture wearing it.</p>

<p>As for reading, I still haven't started the book I mentioned last week, instead I'm reading a kindle book (surprise, surprise!) called, Growing Up Country: Memories of an Iowa farm girl, By Carol Bodensteiner.  I'm only a few chapters in but I am loving it already.  Having spent my childhood in the country, I can relate to a lot of what has been written.  It seems country life is similar, no matter where you grow up.  I am looking forward to reading more of it tonight.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing everybody's crafty loveliness and reading about your book reviews.  Jacinta x</p>
