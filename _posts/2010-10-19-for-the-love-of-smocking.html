<p>I have always loved smocked outfits. They really are a piece of art.  It took until a couple of months before Scarlett turned 1 for me to finally try my hand at it.  I took one class to get me started and I haven't looked back since.  I had always put it in the too hard basket, although, of course, it wasn't as hard as I had believed it to be!</p>
<p>I must admit that I haven't made many outfits in the last couple of years.  I seem to get part way through an outfit, get interrupted (like having to cook dinner, house work, go to bed etc., etc.), put the outfit away (because of course I craft at the dining table) only to find that the recipient is too big for the outfit when I finally get back to trying to finish it.  So back it goes into my unfinished projects stash, potentially never seeing the light of day again.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of what I have made and actually finished!  I have more, but will have to sift through our photo's that were pre-digital to find them.  Now if only I knew where I have stored them??</p>
