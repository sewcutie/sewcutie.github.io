<p>give them to the kids!  Well actually, we have had a lovely evening, just had a lot of spare time before bed.  I looked at the clock and it was only 5.55pm, we had eaten, kids were in their pjs and teeth were brushed (I somehow gained an hour!).  I gave Scarlett some marbles to share with Jairah and before long they were playing beautifully together, putting marbles into cups and emptying them out again.  Tenneille joined in too.<br />
The girls went off to trade marbles and I am proud to say, they shared them without any issues.  One very happy family indeed!  I love these kind of days.</p>
