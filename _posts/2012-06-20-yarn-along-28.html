<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/06/yarn-along-82.html">Ginny</a> at Small Things.</p>
<p>Yippie!  I have finished the body of my Tea Leaves.  Now on to the sleeves and button band.  Lets see if I can do that by next week!?  I haven't done any knitting the last couple of days.  We had a small earthquake/earth tremor here last night, which kind of threw me out and tonight I fell asleep on the couch while Greg read the girls their nighttime story, so I think I should have an early night!  Although the wind is blowing something fierce here tonight, which is rather unnerving, with the huge trees that surround us.</p>

The picture was taken at nearly 9pm with poor lighting.[/caption]</p>
<p>I'm plodding away at my book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Keeper-People-Book-One-ebook/dp/B0055HYNH4">Keeper Of The People</a>, but the plot is still developing, so not much to report.  It seems to be an ok read so far though.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing what all you talented people have been up to this past week.  Jacinta x</p>
