<p>Thought I'd start the week off with a delicious cake recipe.  What better way to embrace Monday than with a piece of cake in one hand and a hot cuppa in the other.  This is really yummy and is wheat and dairy free.  It has a lovely moist texture with a slight meringue crust.  It's a very uncomplicated cake that you can whip up quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>250gm walnuts, ground finely (use a blender or Thermomix)<br />
5 eggs, separated<br />
1/2-3/4 cup brown sugar, depending on how sweet you want<br />
1-2 tbspn rum, optional otherwise 1 tsp vanilla essence<br />
grated zest of 1 lemon</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Pre-heat oven to 180 degrees celsius or 160 degrees celsius for fan-forced oven.</p>
<p>Cream egg yolks and sugar, mix in rum and lemon zest.</p>
<p>Beat the egg whites until firm.  Fold into egg yolk mixture then add walnuts.  Mix gently until just combined.  Pour into greased and lined springform cake tin (I used a 23cm).  Bake in oven for approximately 40 minutes or until skewer comes out clean.  Once cake has cooled, remove from tin and place on serving plate.</p>
