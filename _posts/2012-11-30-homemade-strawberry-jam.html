<p>Only I would have the great idea of making strawberry jam on a day where the temperature was in the mid 30's (celsius).  A friend and I had the idea to go berry picking, only to arrive at one (of many) berry farms to find we had to pay over $12 for adults and over $6 for children, just for the privilege of picking berries.  The guy kindly pointed out that, that price entitled you to the first 1.5kg berries!  Um, I don't think so.  So we promptly hopped back in the car and headed up the road to another farm.  I'm happy to say the next farm was much more friendly price-wise, with the purchase of a huge box of strawberries for $15, probably about 7-8kg.  They were so sweet and juicy.  Some of them where monsters in size.  I knew I would have to cook the strawberries up the same night or they would spoil.  Needless to say, I was up till late making multiple batches of jam, but I'm happy to say that our pantry is now looking well stocked of jam.  I think I will be back there next week to purchase more berries to make another batch to see us through till next berry season.</p>
<p>Just out of interest, I used both my Thermomix and the stovetop to cook the jam.  The Thermomix made a more smooth, but runnier jam, but with the benefit of not having to stir it.  The Thermomix jug rinsed out easily with no scrubbing.  Cooking the jam on the stovetop produced a thicker more chunky jam, but I had to continuously stir it to prevent it sticking on the bottom.  I had to soak the pot afterwards.  There was no difference in the taste.</p>
<p>As for sterilising jars, I prefer to boil my jars and lids.</p>
