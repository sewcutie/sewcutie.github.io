<p>While <del datetime="2011-12-15T03:36:53+00:00">procrastinating</del> having a break from doing some essential Christmas crafting, I stumbled upon a great collection of Christmas craft ideas.  I deemed it worthy of sharing here.  I hope it offers some inspiration to you.  <a href="http://www.thedailybuzz.com.au/2011/12/25-fabulous-christmas-crafts/">Linky here</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Tenneille's quilt is coming along nicely.  I have decided to add another border to the quilt (hadn't yet attached it in the photo), as it was a little small.  That teaches me not to double check measurements given in inches as I am more familiar with centimetres.</p>

<p>I hope you are enjoying the lead up to the festive season so far? Jacinta x</p>
