<p>We spent the afternoon waiting for our hot cross buns to be ready.  I used a recipe my bread machine came with.  The buns always come up so soft and yummy and have a spice glaze.  While waiting for the buns to cook the girls were singing renditions of Hot Cross Buns and a cute song they made up that went "Mama is the best cook in the world, cook in the world" over and over.  So very cute!</p>
<p>Scarlett helped me glaze them and she couldn't get enough of the smell, (well they are so gorgeously spicy in fragrance).  Of course lashings of butter were in order to top off our afternoon snack and a cup of tea for me to wash down my <del datetime="2011-04-18T06:05:57+00:00">bun</del> buns.  Now the question is, do hot cross buns suffice as dinner?</p>
