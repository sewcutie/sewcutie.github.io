<p>I don't think a Sunday night dinner is complete without a little something special.  This apple and rhubarb crumble is no exception.  It's so yummy, it's hard not to go back for seconds, if only is wasn't so filling.   My kids love it too with a nice helping of cream.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>(This recipe makes enough for one large crumble or two smaller.)</p>
<p>1.5kg apple (I use a mix of apples for maximum flavour)<br />
500gm rhubarb<br />
1/3 cup honey or sugar (you can adjust this amount to suit your taste)<br />
1 cup flour (I use wholemeal spelt, but use what you prefer)<br />
80gm butter<br />
1/3 cup brown sugar<br />
1/2 cup oats<br />
1 tsp cream of tartar<br />
1/2 tsp bi carb soda (baking soda)<br />
1/2 tsp mixed spice<br />
1 1/2 cup water</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Peel, core and chop apples and place in pot along with chopped rhubarb.  Place the apple skins and cores in a separate pot with 1 1/2 cups of water.  Cover and place this pot on stove to simmer for about 10 mins.  Remove from stove and strain the juice off into the other pot containing the chopped apples and rhubarb.  This adds extra flavour.<br />
Place the apple and rhubarb on the stove and simmer with the lid on until fruit has soften, stirring occasionally.  Add desired amount of sugar or honey and stir through. Turn off heat and set aside.</p>
<p>Meanwhile sift flour, cream of tartar, bi carb and spice into a bowl.  Add oats.  Rub in butter until mixture resembles breadcrumbs.  Add in sugar and stir through.</p>
<p>Place desired amount of stewed apple and rhubarb, while still warm, into baking dish with high sides.  Sprinkle a good amount of crumble on top.  Bake in a moderate oven for approximately 30 minutes or until slightly golden brown.  Serve with cream or ice cream if desired.</p>
<ul>
<li>With any left over stewed apple and rhubarb, you can place it in the freezer to use at a later date.  You can also freeze the crumble mix too.</li>
<li>If you don't want to simmer the skins and cores, just add 1 1/2 cups of water directly to the apple and rhubarb and cook as directed.</li>
</ul>
