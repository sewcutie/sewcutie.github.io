<p>Hello!  Just popping in to say I'm still here, I can't believe I have been away from this space for so long, I've miss it and I've missed you all.  I'd like to have house news to share with you, but alas, we are still on the market.  We seem to be getting plenty of interest now spring is here, so we are hoping that means a house sale is not far away.  It certainly is a gorgeous time of year in the hills, with beautiful blossoms bursting into life everyday.  Our garden is at its best now, with the rhododendrons out it flower and new spring growth everywhere, not to mention the daily visits from all the birds that we are lucky enough to have living here.  I've been picking the flowers and bringing a little bit of spring indoors.  Thankfully spring makes these testing times a little more bearable.  I hope life is being good to you and I am looking forward to reconnecting with the 'blogging world'.</p>
