<p>Oh yes, bugs are big around here.  Or should I say slugs!   Enormous almost doesn't cut it.  They are know as Leopard Slugs (Limax Maximus).  As it has been so wet around here of late, they have been very active, but only ever at night.  We don't actually know where they hide out during daylight hours.  We have learnt that it's not a good idea to walk around barefoot outside our house when it is dark and wet.  I am sure you can guess why!  Did I hear someone say eeew?  Well that is an understatement.  Shall we leave it at that?</p>
