<p>I was so excited to find I had won a blog giveaway recently from the lovely MJ at <a href="http://www.wanderwonderdiscover.com/">Wander, Wonder, Discover</a>.  It is Mary Oliver's Owls and Other Fantasies book.  I can see it becoming a favourite of our little self proclaimed animal lover, Tenneille.  There are lots of lovely passages throughout the book.  I must say The Swan is one of my favourites and Wild Geese too.<br />
The book arrived last week and was waiting for me after a most stressful and emotionally draining day.  I love how life seems to balance out like that.  I think I may have even given the package a hug!</p>

<p>I took the photo on our new island bench, so you can get a sneaky peaky at what it looks like.  It's so sparkly and pretty.  We have had a hold up with our pantry doors and a set of drawer fronts that the kitchen company forgot with our initial delivery, and then they arrived at the warehouse damaged, so until they turn up, I will have to make you wait for final photos (so frustrating!).  Jacinta x</p>
