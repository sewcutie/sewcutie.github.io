<p>These wontons are pretty popular around here.  It is really hard around these parts to get good Asian food, so I have come up with my own recipe that has stood the test of time and children!  All our three love them and there generally aren't any leftovers. They can be frozen and be cooked at a later date.  If you don't like fried food, you can steam them instead to make gyoza.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><strong>:<br />
</strong>(Makes approx. 40)</p>
<p><em>Make sure all your ingredients are as dry as can be, as too much moisture inside the wonton will result in soggy wontons.</em></p>
<p>1 pkt wonton wrappers (approximately 40 wrappers)<br />
300gm (10.5oz.) pork and veal mince<br />
100gm (3.5oz.) water chestnuts<br />
2 spring onions/green onions<br />
2 cloves garlic<br />
4 sprigs coriander/cilantro<br />
1cm (3/4inch) piece ginger, grated<br />
1 tbsp (1/2 fl. oz.) soy sauce/tamari<br />
1/2 tsp sesame oil<br />
1 egg, beaten</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Using a food processor, blend the garlic &amp; spring onions until finely chopped. Add the rest of the ingredients and blend until just combined.  Spread out the wonton wrappers on a clean, dry surface.  Add a small teaspoon full of mixture to the centre of each wrapper. Lightly brush egg wash around the inside edges of each wonton.  Fold up the wrappers around the meat, joining opposite corners.</p>

<p>Place wontons into shallow hot oil.  Turn as needed and cook until golden brown.  Drain on paper towel before serving.</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong></p>
<p>If you don't want to fry the wontons, you can cook them like a gyoza.  To do so, steam them in a bamboo steamer for approximately 10 minutes.  Once steamed you can serve them as is or you can also lightly pan fry them in a tablespoon of oil until they are slightly browned on each side.</p>
<p>If you don't have a food processor, just make sure you finely chop the garlic, spring onions, coriander and water chestnuts before adding the other ingredients.</p>
<p>You can make the wontons up and freeze them uncooked.  They will keep for about 3 months.</p>
<p><strong>Dipping sauce:</strong></p>
<p>our favourite dipping sauce is made up of equal parts soy sauce and fresh lemon juice or lime juice, add a couple of drops of sesame oil and a few leaves of coriander.  If you don't have lemon juice or lime juice you can substitute with vinegar.</p>

<p>Enjoy!  Jacinta x</p>
