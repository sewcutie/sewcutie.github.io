<p>Scarlett is now reading and is so excited with her achievement.  Well I should say, she is confident enough in herself to admit she can read.  She has been able to read for a little while now, but she didn't think she could.  Oh my sweet girl is her own worst critic.  She want to know how to do everything immediately and if she doesn't, well, it's not often pretty.</p>
<p>One thing I am loving with our Steiner/Waldorf journey is how the children's journey starts off so very slow and repetition is a key in helping the basics stick.   Now for a child like Scarlett who wanted to do everything yesterday, reading has been one of those things she has wanted to do without really trying.  We are pretty big on reading to the children every day and we hope to instill a love of books and literature in general.  Snuggling up in our bed or theirs to read books is one of my favourite times of day.</p>
<p>Slow to begin</p>
<p>Building so it is subliminal</p>
<p>Gentle and rhythmic</p>
<p>Learning is life long no need to rush things</p>
<p>She is about caught up with other children who have been reading since prep</p>
