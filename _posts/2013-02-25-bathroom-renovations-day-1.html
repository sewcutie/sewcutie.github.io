<p>I never thought the day would arrive, that our bathrooms would ever be renovated.  Our tradie has been held up on a few jobs and after a few false starts, he arrived this morning to relieve us of our dated bathrooms.  We are putting a new shower in our ensuite and tiling around the vanity and in the main bathroom, a new shower and retiling around the existing bath and vanity.  It took us 11 months to try and decide what kind of tile and colour to go with.  In the end we decided on rectangular white tiles.  We felt it was best to stick with a neutral colour.  I can't wait to see them on the walls.  Fingers crossed the job won't take too long.</p>

<p>The big news is, we are actually doing the house up to sell.  Maybe as soon as next month, if all goes to plan.  We are looking to have a big change, but where to, we are uncertain.  Greg is wanting to have a shift in career, still in IT, but in different direction.  He wants to get more involved in writing Apps for phones and other mobile devices.  It's kind of scary and exciting at the same time.  I'll keep you posted as to what eventuates.  I still have to share our New Zealand adventure with you too!  Ah, blogging, it's either feast of famine isn't it!</p>
<p>I'll be sharing more bathroom updates as the adventure continues.  Jacinta x</p>
