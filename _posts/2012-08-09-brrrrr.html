<p>Talk about crazy winter weather today!  Rain, snow, sleet, hail more rain more hail (you get the picture).  Usually we just contend with a lot of rain and fog in winter, but today Mother Nature certainly mixed it up.  Even Cardamon spent more time than usual asleep (he certainly makes a nice furry heat pack).  I'm already tucked up in bed, as it is the warmest place to be in this kind of weather.  Will be interesting to see what tomorrow brings, until then, at least I know I will be snug as a bug!</p>

<p>For all you lovelies in the Northern Hemisphere that have been sweltering though a hot summer, I hope this post makes you feel a little cooler!  Jacinta x</p>
