<p>Pancakes are part of our weekend ritual and help to make our weekend get off to a great start.  I have, over the years, created a recipe that produces nice fluffy pancakes. The trick is to beat the egg whites.  Top them off with fresh berries, pure maple syrup and cream - yum!<br />
I use a mix of flours.  It depends what's in the pantry.  I usually use one cup of wholemeal or spelt flour and one cup of white/unbleached flour.  Of course you can use just one type of flour.  I make my own buttermilk, which only takes a couple of minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients - </strong>(makes approx 10 large pancakes)</p>
<p>2 cups plain flour<br />
2 tsp cream of tartar<br />
1 tsp Bi-carb soda<br />
2 to 3 eggs, separated<br />
500ml cows milk<br />
1 lemon<br />
1 cup cottage cheese<br />
Zest of 1 orange, finely grated<br />
pinch of salt<br />
Butter or cooking spray for pan</p>
<p><strong>Method -</strong></p>
<p>To make buttermilk, squeeze the lemon and add the juice to the milk.  Whisk lightly.  Set aside.  Into a bowl, sift flour, bi-carb and cream of tartar.  Add egg yolks, cottage cheese, buttermilk and orange zest and stir until combined.<br />
In a separate bowl, beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form.  Gently stir egg whites into the batter until just combined.</p>
<p>In a pre heated pan, add butter or cooking spray and pour in desired amount of batter.  Cook until bubbles appear.  Flip pancake and cook until golden brown.  Repeat until desired amount of pancakes are cooked.  Serve with your favourite toppings.</p>
<p><strong>Variation:</strong></p>
<p>Omit cottage cheese and replace with 1/2 cup sour cream. Follow recipe as above. Makes for very light and smooth textured pancakes.</p>
<p>Enjoy!!</p>
