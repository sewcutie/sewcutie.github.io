<p>I had one of those rare afternoons, where I found myself with a book in hand, well to be precise, a kindle book on my phone, in hand and two sleeping children.  An hour to myself, such a precious and rare event.  Tenneille fell asleep across my knees on the couch in less than 5 minutes after she snuggled up with me.  Jairah was in bed, fast asleep.  The book I am reading is written by Barbara Kingslover, it's called The Lacuna.  I've only just started reading it, but like all her books, I <em>love</em> it so far.  She is an amazing writer.  I have read a few of her other books, like the Poison Wood bible, Prodigal Summer; Animal, Vegetable, Mineral; Small Wonder, High Tide in Tucson &amp; The Bean Trees.  Actually, I think I have read most of her books.  A dear friend of mine put me on to Kingslover and I am so glad she did.  She makes words flow across a page with such depth, I am drawn in like a leaf to an eddy. I find it very hard to put her books down once I start reading.  Did I say I love her books, oh yeah, I did!</p>

<p>After the heart wrenching task of having to wake two children to go and pick up Scarlett from school, we were treated to an impromptu swim at a friend's house.  To say the kids were excited was an understatement.  Afterwards we met up with Greg for dinner.  I left Greg with the girls and Jairah and I went home via the supermarket to get some much needed groceries.  As I drove out of the car park, I caught a glimpse of the most amazing sunset.  I had to duck down a side street in town to try and get a photo.  We don't get to see sunsets from our house, as we face north and are surrounded by hills.  So there you have it.  A busy, but wonderful afternoon had by yours truly, Jacinta x.</p>
