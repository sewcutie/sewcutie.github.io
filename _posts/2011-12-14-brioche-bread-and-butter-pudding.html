<p>I bought some chocolate chip brioche bread this week for something a little different.  I decided to try it out in a bread and butter pudding recipe.  The result was really tasty.  It's not too sweet and is quick and easy to make.  I like to leave the crust on the bread, as it gives it a little bit of crunch when cooked.  The recipe is adapted from, The Woman's Weekly Sweet Old Fashioned Favourites.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>6 slices chocolate chip brioche bread (plain brioche or other bread is suitable to substitute)<br />
2 1/2 cups milk<br />
3 eggs<br />
1/4 cup raw sugar<br />
1 tsp vanilla essence<br />
1/4 tsp nutmeg<br />
Butter to spread on bread</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread.  Cut each slice into 4 triangles.  Arrange in an ovenproof dish, slightly overlapping each piece of bread.  In a jug, whisk milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla essence and nutmeg until combined.  Pour liquid over bread and let it sit for about 5 mins to allow liquid to soak into the bread.  Place dish in a pre heated, oven at 160 degrees celsius (325F) for approximately 45 minutes or until slightly browned on top.  Serve warm with a dollop of cream if desired.  Will serve 4-6 people.</p>
