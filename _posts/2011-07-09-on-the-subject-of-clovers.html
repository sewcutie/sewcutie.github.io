<p>Now if a four-leaf clover is meant to symbolise good luck, then what does a five-leaf clover symbolise?  Perhaps a double dose of good luck? The girls were hunting for four-leaf clovers the other day and came across this five-leaf clover in our yard (isn't it just the prettiest green).</p>

<p>They were so excited when they came inside.  I for one, have never seen one with more than four leaves before.  We seem to have a patch in the backyard that is very reliable for finding the four-leaf variety.</p>

<p>They have been back looking for more with five leaves, but as yet, this is the only one.  Have you ever found one with more than four leaves?  Jacinta x</p>
