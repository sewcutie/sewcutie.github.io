<p>One of Tenneille's birthday gifts was a dress I made for her.  Now I must say this dress has a twirl factor of 10!  It's a fairly simple pattern and apart from some shirring issues, it made up very quickly.  The pattern is called Molly Mae and is by Amy Hamberlin of Kati Cupcakes pattern co.  This is the second pattern I have used by her.  The first was <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=689">Scarlett's quilt</a>.  The sizing goes from 12 months through to 10 years.  So I can foresee making quite a few of these.  The pattern was originally purchased from The Fat Quarter online shop, but I don't think they stock it now, however, it is available <a href="http://katicupcake.bigcartel.com/product/molly-mae">here</a>.  The fabric comes from my stash.  I originally purchased it from Spotlight some years ago.  Now to make one for Scarlett.  I can just imagine all the twirling fun they are going to have together.  Makes me want one too.</p>

<p>I'm sure there will be many more photos of this dress to come, as Tenneille declared it 'best ever dress'.   Jacinta x</p>
