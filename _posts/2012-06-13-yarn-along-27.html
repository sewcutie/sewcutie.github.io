<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/06/yarn-along-81.html">Ginny</a> at Small Things.</p>
<p>My Tea Leaves cardi is coming along beautifully.  The pattern is so easy to follow and my Knit Pro needles are so lovely, can't believe I held off so long getting them.  I am knitting any chance I get, but it's still taking a while to get the body of the cardigan knitted.  It's kind of like that feeling where you knit and knit and don't really feel like you have gotten any length added.  Just have to remind myself that knitting the front and back at the same time does take a while, but the thought of not having to sew seams will keep me inspired to keep on knitting.</p>

<p>As for reading, that is pretty much non existant.  I've probably only read about five pages of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Keeper-People-Book-One-ebook/dp/B0055HYNH4/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338372758&amp;sr=1-1">Keeper of the People</a>, by Karah Quinney.  So not much to report there.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing all the beautiful creations from you all this week.  Jacinta x</p>
