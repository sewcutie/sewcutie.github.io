<p>What a busy weekend.  The kids and I escaped to Ballarat so Greg could get to work on putting the flooring down in the kitchen.<br />
The weather on Saturday was glorious and we decided to head to Daylesford.  I had intended to do some Christmas shopping at a store I have been dying to visit.  I went in to the store all excited (like a kid-in-a-lolly-shop excited), only to find I couldn't get anything on my list!  I was so disappointed.  I do believe I walked out with a pout on my face as did the woman who walked out behind me. She too had made a special trip to the shop, only to find she couldn't get what she wanted either (I know, boo-hoo!).<br />
The kids meanwhile, went to an op/thrift shop with my mum and all came out happy with their new found treasures.  Made me realise that I don't need to purchase those more expensive items I couldn't get and that I may as well shop for their Christmas presents at the op shop.  They would be just as happy.</p>
<p>We enjoyed our picnic lunch in a beautiful park.  Right next to the picnic table was a lovely gently sloping hill, which called to Tenneille to roll down it grassy banks.</p>

<p>We found a lovely pond by chance on Sunday, where the girls played for nearly an hour while I watched dragonflies dance across the pond's surface.  Of course the dragonflies wouldn't stay still long enough to capture.</p>

<p>We wondered a bit further and happend across some beautiful roses.  They were so heady in scent, I think I nearly passed out from their beautiful fragrance.  I love roses and I'm sure you would spot me a mile away as the woman who stops a every bloom and breaths in their beauty.</p>

<p>A spot of plumbing took place in the afternoon (I was the one who broke the bathroom tap, whoops!).  Thank goodness my mum is handy and she had an apprentice at hand.</p>

<p>We were meant to go home Sunday afternoon, but Greg needed a bit more time to finish the floor, so we came home Monday instead. I am happy to say the floor has come up beautifully.  The kitchen is so close to being finished.  Just need to get the kick boards put on, the drawers (that finally showed up last week) need to be installed and the splash back needs to be put up (still deciding on the colour).</p>
<p>I must say, I have had to really embrace this journey, as it has taken a lot longer than I had anticipated and tested my ability to 'embrace it all' so to speak!  I have had to do a lot of deep breathing, to the point if you have felt light-headed over these last few weeks, it's because I have used more than my fair share of oxygen.</p>
<p>So for now, my dear, patient readers, here is a little sneak peek of the floor.  Of course we are tossing up whether to pull up those couple of lighter boards and redistribute them amongst the darker boards.  Hmm, will sit with it a few days before we commit.</p>
