<p>Well what better way to honour the Queen's birthday long weekend than to eat crumpets and have a cuppa.  Ok, I will admit we aren't hardcore royalists, it's just it was cold here today and we wanted something warm and yummy.  Crumpets seemed to fit the bill.  Topped with butter and local honey and we had some eyes-rolling-into-back-of-head kind of afternoon tea going on.  Crumpets are quick and easy to make, but don't expect to have any leftover.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:<br />
</strong>(Makes approximately 12 crumpets)</p>
<p>1 cup plain flour<br />
1 cup spelt flour (can use 2 cups of plain flour)<br />
1 1/2 cups lukewarm water<br />
7gm dried yeast<br />
1 tsp baking powder<br />
1 tsp sugar<br />
1/2 tsp salt</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar and salt into mixing bowl.  In a separate jug add dried yeast to water and stir until combined.  Add liquid to dry ingredients and mix until batter is smooth.  Heat a pan over a low heat.  Place egg rings in pan and spray liberally with cooking spray.  Fill egg rings about 3/4 full with batter.  Cook on low heat for approximately 10 minutes or until crumpet is cooked through.  Place cooked crumpets on cooling rack and cook the rest of the batter in the same manner.  To serve, place cooled crumpets in a toaster and heat through.  Top with butter and honey or your choice of toppings.</p>

<p>Ah, long live the Queen, crumpets and hot cups of tea!  Jacinta x</p>
