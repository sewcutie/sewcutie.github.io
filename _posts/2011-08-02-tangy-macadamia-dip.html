<p>I love making dips for quick and easy snacks to share or to take along to a party.  I came up with this recipe last summer and made it again the other day to take to a candle party (the party plan kind), where I offered to bring a plate (with food on it of course!).  It's quick and easy to make.  It's vegan and non-dairy too.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>100gm raw macadamia nuts, unsalted<br />
1 carrot, coarsely chopped<br />
1 tomato, coarsely chopped<br />
Lemon juice to taste,  (I use about 1/2 a lemon)<br />
1/4 tsp cummin<br />
salt to taste</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Add macadamia nuts to food processor along with the carrot and blend briefly.  Add tomato, lemon juice, cummin and salt and blend until well combined.   Place into a dish and serve with your favourite crackers.</p>
<p><strong>Variations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You could toast the macadamia nuts for a stronger nut flavour.</li>
<li>Try your favourite nut in place of macadamia.</li>
</ul>
