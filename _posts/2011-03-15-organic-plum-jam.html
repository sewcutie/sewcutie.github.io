<p>I purchased a couple of kilo's of blood plums in our organic order last week, intending on making jam.  I'm happy to say, I actually got the jam made before the girls ate all the plums.  I always cut down on the sugar content of jam, as I still like to taste the flavour of the fruit.  With my plum jam I like to leave the skin on.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>1.5 kg organic blood plums (or what is available at the time)<br />
500gm organic raw sugar</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Score the skin of the plums and place in a suitable pot.  Place the lid on the pot and simmer plums on a low heat for approximately 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally. After this time, remove the lid from the pot while still simmering and let the liquid reduce by half.  Remove pips from the jam.  Using a sieve, remove some of the lumps in the jam by pushing through with a spoon.  Add the pulp left in the sieve back into the jam. Repeat until jam is thick and has a fairly smooth texture.<br />
About 10 minutes before jaring jam, add the sugar and stir until dissolved.  At the same time, add your jars to a separate pot of rapidly boiling water for 10 minutes.  Remove jars from water carefully with tongs and place on a tea towel.  Carefully ladle jam into prepared jars (make sure your jars are still hot to avoid the glass breaking).  Place the lids on jars and seal immediately.  This recipe should yield enough jam to fill 3 medium size jars or approximately 4 cups (1 cup=250ml).  Store in a cool, dark place.  Jam should keep for approximately 6 - 12 months if stored correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Helpful hints:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Count the number of plums before adding to the pot so you know how many pips need to be removed.</li>
<li>I find using jars with pop up seal tops (they make a clicking sound when pressed when seal on the jar is broken) the best, as they will re-seal if you close the lid immediately after placing the jam in the jar.  This helps keep your jam for longer.</li>
</ol>
