<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/08/yarn-along-88.html">Ginny</a> at Small Things.</p>
<p>I have had a very industrious week, knitting-wise.  I finished my <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1869">Ruby Tea Leaves cardi</a> .  I love it and it fits beautifully.  I also finished the cowl I was knitting for my friend's birthday, which I named <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1850">Créme de la Créme Loop</a>.  I posted about them both earlier in the week.  You can see my notes on my Ravelry page too (I now have a linky button on the right side of my blog page).</p>
<p>I am currently knitting a hat for Scarlett's friend, whose birthday party is this coming Saturday.  It is an easy pattern that knits up quick.  The pattern can be found <a href="http://www.lincraft.com.au/view_project.php?id=296">here</a>.  I have finished the main part of the hat, just need to do the earflaps, i-cord and I'll add tassels to the ends of the i-cord.  I've knitted this pattern quite a few times now and come back to it when I need a quick gift.  The yarn I'm using is from my stash, Cleckheaton Country Silk 8ply.</p>

<p>Can't wait to see what you have all been up to over the last week.  Jacinta x</p>
