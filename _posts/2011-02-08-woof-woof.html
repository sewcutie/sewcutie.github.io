<p>I was at the supermarket with Jairah the other day.  It was much later in the day then I would normally go (well in truth I try to avoid the supermarket at all costs, not really sure what's so 'super' to be honest) and knew that a distraction was in order to get the shopping done.  I headed for the pet food isle and grabbed a tin of dog food.  Jairah was very happy to tote the tin around the supermarket.  We made all sorts of dog noises and he happily showed everyone we passed his 'dog', referring to the picture on the tin.<br />
It got me thinking about the little things we can do with little children present that if we tried while on our own we would be, well, looked upon as a little strange.  In this case I am talking about all the dog noises I was making for Jairah's entertainment.  Barking while walking around a supermarket sure is something, though I must say the smile on Jairah's face was worth looking a little silly for.  I try to make the most of these situations, because one day it just won't be cool for mama to bark like a dog while pushing a shopping trolley!</p>
