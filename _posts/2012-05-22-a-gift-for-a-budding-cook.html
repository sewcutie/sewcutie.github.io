<p>Tenneille had a school friend's party to go to on the weekend.  It was a cooking party, so we decided to make the gift kitchen themed.  I made the birthday girl an apron and added a cookbook and some muffin pans to complete the gift.  I had fun using the embroidery function on my sewing machine to add a little personal touch to the apron.</p>

<p>I didn't use a pattern, but used one of my existing aprons as a guide.  I might write up a tutorial, as it was a fun and quick gift, that I might have to make again.</p>
<p>The party was a lot of fun.  The adults were well catered for with drink and nibbles provided, while our little budding chefs got stuck into some serious pasta wrangling.  Now, I have three more birthdays coming up this week in which I need to make gifts for.  Lets see if I can pull it off.  I still have to get a gift posted off to a friend's son, whose birthday was back in April (hanging my head in shame Bec).  I seem to have an aversion to going to the post office, must get over that!</p>
