<p>I'm hoping to make this a regular feature on the blog.  Lovin' This Space will document little spaces that I want to share with you.  Little snippets of loveliness.  This picture is from our ensuite.  I purchased the gorgeous orchid on the weekend.  I knew immediately when I saw the orchid, I had the perfect spot for it.  Now every time I pass by the door to the ensuite, I catch myself stopping and staring at it's graceful beauty.</p>
