<p>The following one is cheeky, but I love it just the same!</p>
<p>"May those who love us, love us; and those who don't love us, may God turn their hearts; and if he doesn't turn their hearts, may he turn their ankles so we'll know them by their limping."<br />
<em><strong>Traditional Irish Toast </strong></em></p>
<p>"It is easy to be pleasant when life flows by like a song, but the man worth while is the one who will smile when everything goes dead wrong. For the test of the heart is trouble, and it always comes with years, and the smile that is worth the praises of earth is the smile that shines through the tears."<br />
<em><strong>Irish Saying</strong></em></p>
