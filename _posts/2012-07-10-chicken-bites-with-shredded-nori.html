<p>These bite size pieces of chicken are so tasty and really hard to stop eating!  They are gluten free too.  We serve them with vegetables and noodles, but they would also be yummy as canapés.  The recipe was originally from a Women's Weekly cookbook.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>500gm chicken breast, cut into cubes<br />
1/4 cup soy sauce/Tamari<br />
1/4 cup mirin<br />
ginger, a small knob, finely grated<br />
1 nori sheet, finely chopped<br />
1/3 cup cornflour<br />
oil for frying</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Place soy sauce, mirin, ginger and cut up chicken into a bowl, toss so the pieces are evenly coated.  Marinate for at least 15 minutes in the fridge.  Once marinated, drain off any excess liquid.  Mix the cornflour with the nori, and using your fingers, lightly coat each piece of chicken in the cornflour mixture.<br />
Heat oil in a wok or high sided pan over a medium heat.  Fry the chicken in batches until golden brown, turing regularly.  Drain chicken on paper towel.<br />
Serve with noodles or rice and vegetables of your choice.  They are yummy dipped in mayonnaise too.</p>
