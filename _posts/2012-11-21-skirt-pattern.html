<p>here is a fairly quick and easy skirt pattern you could whip up in an afternoon for that special little girl in your life.  It's a great way to use up some fabric, as you only need a small amount.</p>
<p>What you need:</p>
<p>The width of fabric use was 112cm or 44"</p>
<p>29"  fabric x width of fabric if you want the same fabric for both skirt tiers or 11" for the top tier and 2 x 9" strips for the bottom tier<br />
contrasting thread<br />
elastic for waist band, you can use standard elastic suitable for waist bands or use buttonhole elastic, approximately 3/4" wide<br />
1 button if using button hole elastic</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>Cut 1 11" strip by width of fabric and cut 2, 9" strip by width of fabric.  Overlock (serger) or hem along each top and bottom edge of all the fabric strips to prevent fraying.</p>
<p>Take the 9" strip and along the bottom edge, fold it up by 1/4", and press.  Fold up a further 1" and press.  Sew along the pressed edge to make your skirt hem.</p>
<p>Fold the fabric in half, right sides facing and pin along edge.  Sew with a 1/2" seam.  Overlock or hem the seam.</p>
<p>Fold fabric so right side is facing out.  Loosen the tension on your sewing machine and length the stitch and sew two gathering rows along the top of your skirt tier.  Start the first gathering row 1/2" in from the top of the tier.  Start the second gathering row about 1/4" from the first gathering row.  Leave a tail at each end of the gathering rows, as this will help you tie the cotton when you are gathering it up and prevent you pulling out the stitches.  Set aside.</p>
<p>Next take the 11" strip and fold in half so right sides of fabric are facing in.  Pin and sew the side seam with a 1/2" seam allowance.  Overlock the edge.</p>
<p>Pick up the 9" strip and tie one end of the gathering treads together so they don't pull through.  Start gently pulling up the thread until it matches the bottom hem of the 11" skirt tier.</p>
