<p>I whipped this up for Greg and I for lunch today.  Greg works from home on a Wednesday, so I tend to try and make something a little more interesting for us to eat.  The creaminess of this soup comes from cashews, so it's dairy free and using my thermomix, I don't use any oil. Tastes lovely and leaves you wanting a second helping.  Of course you can make it on the stovetop too.  I love that this soup is filling without the addition of dairy, wheat or meat and the nuts help to keep you feeling full for longer.  I hope you try it out!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:<br />
</strong>(Makes approximately 6 serves)</p>
<p>1 potato, roughly chopped<br />
1 carrot, roughly chopped<br />
1 onion, roughly chopped<br />
2 cloves garlic<br />
4 stalks of celery, roughly chopped<br />
100gm unsalted cashews or measure as a good handful, raw or roasted<br />
salt to taste</p>
<p><strong>Thermomix method:</strong></p>
<p>Chop onion and garlic roughly and place in thermomix. Blend on speed 4-5 for 5 seconds.  Set temperature to 100 degrees and cook for 2 minutes on speed 2.  Add the rest of the vegetables and cashews to the onions and garlic.  Blend on speed 7 for 5 seconds.  Pour in approximately 800gms water.  Set temperature to 100 degrees on speed 3 for 20 minutes.  Add salt or preferred seasoning and blend on speed 7 for 60 seconds to achieve a smooth consistency.</p>

<p><strong>Conventional method:</strong></p>
<p>Place chopped onions and garlic in a saucepan with a small amount of oil.  Cook off for a couple of minutes.  Add the rest of the chopped vegetables and cashews.  Pour in about 800ml to 1 litre of water.  Simmer for about 20-25 minutes until vegetables are cooked through.  Add salt or vegetable stock to taste.  Blend the soup to a smooth consistency with a food processor or handheld blender, using caution due to heat.</p>
