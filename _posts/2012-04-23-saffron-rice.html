<p><strong>To make saffron rice using a rice cooker:</strong></p>
<p>Using the rice cooker measuring cup, add 3 cups of rice (basmati is my favourite) that has been lightly rinsed under cold running water, add to the rice cooker and fill with cold water to the 3 cup line.  Steep a pinch of saffron threads in a small amount of boiling water for a few minutes, then pour, saffron threads and all, into the rice cooker.  Add about 2 tablespoons of chicken stock powder (Massel's brand), stir lightly and cook.  Once cooked, lightly fluff the rice before serving.</p>
