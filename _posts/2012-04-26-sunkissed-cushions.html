<p>I have had it in mind for a while now, to make some cushions for Tennielle's room to match her <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1509">birthday quilt</a>.  As the weather has settled into some rather wintery conditions, we have been spending a lot of time indoors, which means I have managed to sneak in some sewing time much to my delight.  I had so much fun piecing the cushions together from the leftover quilt scraps.  In fact, I can see myself getting addicted to making them, as they are quick and easy to put together.  The larger pillow I stuffed with a spare cushion insert we had lying around.  The smaller cushion I left unfilled, as I thought it would be a great place for Tenneille to put her pyjamas.  She was delighted to find them on her bed this afternoon and she managed to find her pyjamas hidden in the cushion.  Not much escapes that girl.</p>

<p>I still think that Sweetwater's Sunkissed is one of my all time favourite fabric lines.  I still have a little of it left, but might just have to put it aside, but then again, you can't have too many cushions, can you?</p>
