<p>Saturday was well spent in our garden.  We finally had a free Saturday and ideal weather to have a bonfire. The amount of tree litter that our lovely Mountain Ash trees gift us is almost unsurmountable.  We need to burn off at least every 6 months to keep our yard looking somewhat kept.  I just love the smell of the eucalyptus burning and the workout from walking up and down our hillside block, while dragging great bundles of twigs, is great exercise indeed.  Now if I did this everyday, I'd be a contender for some sort of iron woman contest.  Greg certainly earnt his keep with keeping the bonfire burning too.  I think the girls may have contributed a stick or two, before skipping off to some very important fairy house construction.</p>

<p>It was lovely to sit around the fire at the end of the day with the kids and toast marshmallows.  The girls also love to <del datetime="2011-12-04T11:31:44+00:00">burn</del> cook apples over the coals too.  I figure it's a great way to top ones-self off after eating so many marshmallows.  Suffice to say, the kids didn't need much dinner.</p>

<p>Bonfire days around here are up there with some of the most anticipated days of the year (I'm taking Christmas and Easter).  Do you have something that you look forward to doing as a family too?  Jacinta x</p>
