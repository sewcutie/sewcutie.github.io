<p>My quilt is finished, yay!  Unfortunately the weather hasn't co operated as yet to use it for a picnic, but I couldn't wait to show it to you.  Made from a layer cake of Kate Spain's Good Fortune fabric and backed and binded with Denise Schmit fabric.  These fabrics are of a lovely weight and are gorgeous to sew with.  The batting is of a wool blend.  I used Aurifil 50w cotton to piece it and bind it.  I must say it is lovely cotton and it didn't tangle when I hand stitched the binding.  I am definitely converted and will be using Aurifil for all my quilts from now on (just want to clarify I'm not being paid to say that, I just like to recommend what I love).</p>

<p>The design is my own and I loved every minute of designing it and putting it together.  I will endeavour to write a pattern for it.  Nothing like sharing some crafty love.</p>

<p>Now, I need to have a chat to some weather gods and ask for some lovely fine weather this weekend and ponder what my next quilt will be.  I do say I am addicted.</p>
