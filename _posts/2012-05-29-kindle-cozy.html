<p>A dear friend celebrated her birthday last week with a craft evening.  I decided to make her Kindle a cover, aka, Kindle Cozy.  In my usual style, I was still sewing her gift an hour before I was meant to be at her birthday.  I made the pattern up as I went, using some Promenade by Riley Blake charm squares (I took some step by step photos so I can write up a tutorial).  The lining fabric was from my stash and it matched the fabric beautifully, in fact there is grey and white spotted fabric in the charm square pack.  It was so hard picking out the squares I liked the best and I can't decide if I like the front or back of the cozy best.  The batting is cotton, so it has plenty of padding to keep the Kindle well protected.</p>
