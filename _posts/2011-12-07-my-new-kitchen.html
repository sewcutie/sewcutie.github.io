<p>For those of you who have been following along my blog for a while you will know we have been in the midst of a kitchen renovation.  I am happy to say it is complete enough to finally share with you all.  We are really happy with how it has all come together.  It's light, bright and there is so much more space to work in.  Our kitchen sits in the centre of our home and it finally feels warm and welcoming.  Oh and the island bench, it is heavenly.  It is close to two metres long and it has really made the kitchen a wonderful space to work and entertain.  We had friend's over the other week and I was able to prepare dinner and chat without walking around people, unlike our previous kitchen.  We are looking forward to many hearty meals together.  I will share details of the renovation at a later date.  <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1224">Remember the kitchen before</a>!  We are so glad to be rid of the old pink kitchen.</p>
