<p>I have been crafting like a crazy woman!  I managed to get a table cloth together with napkins and a table runner sewn up in an afternoon.  I am so happy with the outcome.  I know I wouldn't have been able to purchase anything I like as much in the stores.  I love nostalgic festive fabric.  I find bright red Santas, well, quite scary.  Spotlight have 50% off Christmas fabrics at the moment.  I went to town, so to speak and purchased all sorts of lovely prints.  You will see more of them created into all sorts of goodies as we lead up to the festive season.  I can't wait to share with you all my crafting madness.</p>
