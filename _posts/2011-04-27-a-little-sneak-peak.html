<p>Tenneille's bedroom is in the throws of being renovated.  The girls have been sharing a room, but we have decided they could do with their own room and <del datetime="2011-04-27T00:19:59+00:00">help spread the mess</del> have space to play.  The floating floor is in progress, the walls and wardrobe are painted.  I just need to get a block of time to sew curtains.  I am still deciding if I want to do roman blinds or just the regular pleated curtains.  I chose the fabric pictured below from Sweetwater's Sunkissed secret garden range, printed by Moda.  It is the lemonade colour way.</p>

<p>It matches the feature wall we have painted beautifully.  I ordered the fabric from <a href="http://www.1choice4quilting.com/">1choice4quilting</a>.  Their Sunkissed fabric is a good price and I needed to buy quite a lot.  Shipping price to Australia was very reasonable.  Shawna from 1choice4quilting threw in a few extras too.  I love the saying on the compact mirror/mini sewing kit.  It is definitely how I feel about housework!</p>

<p>I can't wait to show you the room once it is complete.  Jacintax</p>
