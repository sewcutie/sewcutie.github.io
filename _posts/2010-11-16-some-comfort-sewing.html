<p>Scarlett is feeling rather unwell.  What does this mama do?...sew!  Who doesn't want to spend time in their favourite pyjamas when feeling under the weather.  I used a pair of Scarlett's favourite, but worn out pyjama pants as a pattern.  The pants made up rather quickly, considering I had to make lunch and attend to the sick.  Yes, that's right, Greg is now home, unwell and has gone to bed.  It's going to be a fun week around here.</p>

<p>I don't think Cardamon is complaining about things around here at the moment.</p>
