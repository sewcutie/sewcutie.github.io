<p>Curtains, I kind of have a love hate relationship with them.  Partly due to the fact we have all non standard windows in our house and the fact that they collect dust.  We live on a dirt road, so dust is a bit of an issue in summer if you leave the windows open.  Jairah's bedroom window is east facing, so his room is first to see daylight.  He is an early waker as it is, so curtains have been on my to-do list longer than I will admit.  Partly because I couldn't find the right material.  Enter Ikea!  While wondering around the baby/kids section the other day, I came across some cute bunting curtains.  The colours were exactly what I wanted, the drop of the curtains was more than adequate, but of course the width was a little on the narrow side for Jairah's window.  I knew I could get around this by buying two sets of curtains and joining them to get the correct width.</p>
