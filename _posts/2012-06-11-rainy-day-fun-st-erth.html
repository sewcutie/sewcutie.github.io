<p>We spend yesterday afternoon at the lovely <a href="http://www.diggers.com.au/gardens-and-cafes/gardens/st-erth.aspx">St Erth</a> in Blackwood, Victoria.  My children just love the gardens as there are lots of areas to explore, even better apparently when it is raining.  The kids made the most of the loan umbrella's, toting them around the gardens, seriously, I love how easily they entertain themselves sometimes.  They all got to choose a packet of seeds or bulbs on our way out, it was more fun than a lolly shop, oh my, and the pressure of having to narrow down their decision to just one thing.  They were too cute ohhing and arring over what they would like.  I can recommend visiting St Erth if ever you are looking for an enjoyable day out.  We were able to take Cardamon in on a lead too which is nice to know for all you doggie owners.  As a <a href="http://www.diggers.com.au/">Digger's club</a> member, myself and the kids get in to the gardens for free.  Of course, you don't have to be a member to visit or buy their products, but they do offer discounts to members.</p>

<p>Tenneille, Jairah and I planted Tenneille's daffodils today in the glorious sunshine.  We can't wait to see the daffodil's sunny faces pop up in a couple of months.</p>
