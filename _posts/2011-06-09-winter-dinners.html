<p>As we are well and truly in the throws of winter, hearty comfort food seems to be weaving it's way into our dinner menu.  Spatzle is a family favourite.  They are noodles cooked in salted boiling water and smothered in butter.  We serve them with a nice hearty stew, but the kids love them just as much served on their own.</p>
<p>Spatzle Ingredients:</p>
<p>2 cups plain flour (you can use wheat or spelt flour)<br />
3/4-1 cup milk<br />
2eggs<br />
1-2 tbspn butter<br />
1 tsp salt<br />
extra salt for pot</p>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>Mix flour, eggs, milk and salt in a bowl until combined.  The texture should be thick but slightly runny.  Half fill a large pot with water and put on to boil.  Once it starts boiling add a good amount of salt.  Using a large holed colander or potato ricer placed over a bowl, fill it quickly with the mix.  Place the colander/ricer over the pot of boiling water and work the mix through the colander into the boiling water, being careful not to place the colander/ricer into the water.  Once the mix has all been placed in the water, let it cook for a further minute.  Using a slotted spoon, scoop out the noodles into a sieve and drain off the water.  Place them in a serving bowl and add butter to taste.</p>
