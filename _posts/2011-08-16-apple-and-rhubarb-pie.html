<p>I spied rhubarb in the fruit and veg shop the other day and had an instant craving for apple and rhubarb pie.  This is a simple, yet fulfilling dessert that is enjoyed by everyone in this family.  My recipe doesn't have cane sugar.  I use honey as a sweetner and there is no sugar in the crust.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>2 cups plain flour<br />
120gm butter<br />
pinch salt<br />
2-3 tbspn (approximately) water</p>
<p>500gm rhubarb<br />
1.5kg apples (I use about 1kg Granny Smith apples &amp; 500gm of a sweeter apple like Royal Gala)<br />
1/2 cup honey</p>
