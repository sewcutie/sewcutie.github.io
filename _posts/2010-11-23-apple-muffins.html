<p>I am always trying to come up with recipes that are suitable for the kids that are not loaded with sugar.  These muffins fit the bill.  I used honey and apple puree to add sweetness.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />
(Makes approx. 12 muffins)<strong> </strong></p>
<p>1/4 cup honey<br />
3 tbsp oil<br />
1 cup wholemeal flour<br />
1 cup apple puree unsweetened is best (homemade or store bought is fine)<br />
1 egg<br />
1 tsp cream of tartar<br />
1/2 tsp bi-carb soda<br />
1/4 tsp mixed spice (can substitute for cinnamon if desired)</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>With an electric mixer, beat honey and oil until well combined.  Add egg and beat until thick.   Add puree, sifted flour, cream of tartar, bi-carb and spice.  Beat gently until combined.  Place mixture in muffin tin and bake @160 degrees celcius for approximately 12 minutes or until cooked through.  Once cooked, removed muffins from tin and cool on wire rack.  Of course, you can eat them straight out of the oven too!</p>
