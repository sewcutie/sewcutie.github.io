<p>There are a few reasons this poor blog has been so neglected.  Our house is now finally under offer, for the third time!  Who would have thought it would take a year to sell and having so much trouble finding suitable buyers!  We can breath a sigh of relief next week when the sale should go unconditional.</p>
<p>So if that wasn't enough to occupy our time, we are moving, not just down the road or to the next town, but to BOSTON!  So exciting and daunting at the same time.  Greg has been offered a job over there and we have spend the last few months getting the paperwork together to get our visas.  We have a appointment next month at the US consulate to hopefully get the visas initiated.  The house settles next month too, so once that is all done, we are heading off.  We don't have an exact date yet, as we don't want to risk booking airfares just incase there is some hiccup with the visa process.</p>

<p>There are so many things we need to do in the next 4 weeks or so.  I can't think much past today, or my head starts spinning.  Of course we will need to pack up our house, have a garage sale, going away party, ship our furniture, fly some 30+ hours, find somewhere to rent, find a new school, or two, as we aren't sure which grades the girls will go into and a million other things that come with an international move.  We are looking at it as a once in a lifetime adventure that we will make the most of.  I will keep you posted with the process as we go along.  We have been in limbo for so long, it is kind of refreshing to have something so fun to look forward, so let the adventure begin!</p>
<p>Of course if you have any international moving/settling tips you want to share, feel free to do so!</p>
