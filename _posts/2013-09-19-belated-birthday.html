<p>I have had my heart set on a chair I spied in Ikea earlier in the year, with all the house going-ons, I had to wait a few months for my birthday present to come to fruition.  Jairah and I set off to Ikea to purchase my chair.  This was all very exciting until I realised I had to get the huge and awkward shaped box onto the trolly, thankfully a lovely Ikea lady came to my rescue.  It was actually easier to get in the car although a lovely gentleman came running to help me, bless his kind heart.  I couldn't get it home quick enough and try it out.  I am pleased to say it is very comfortable and it is the perfect chair to sit by the fire and <del datetime="2013-09-19T00:41:31+00:00">fall asleep</del>, sit and knit.  Of course a new cushion was in order, so I whipped on up using Sweetwaters "" fabric.  It has the perfect colour combination to match the lovely grey fabric.</p>
