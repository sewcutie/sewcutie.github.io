<p>I love the beautiful celebrations which come with this time of year.  We start our festive celebrations with a visit from St Nicholas.  The kids have left their 'polished' shoes out, on the window sill, ready for St Nicholas to visit during the night to leave treats for the them.  I think the tradition behind St Nicholas is just beautiful.  I haven't come across a nice book, but I did print off <a href="http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/a-st-nicholas-story/">this version of the story</a> a few years back and read it to the children every year.</p>
<p>I made a naive style St Nicholas a few years back, whom I think is my favourite of all our festive decorations.  I love bringing him out every year to mark this special day.</p>
