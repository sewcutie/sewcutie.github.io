<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/04/yarn-along_20.html">Ginny at Small Things </a>yarn along this week.</p>
<p>I have cast on a vest this week.  We went camping over the weekend and I took my knitting in the hope of finding 5 minutes to cast something on.  I in fact, found a whole hour! I got to knit the night we got home too.  The pattern is the Pebble Vest.  I have made quite a few of these over the last few years.  I find it quick to knit and love the fact it is knit all in one.  I am using a 70% wool and 30% soya blend yarn.  It is lovely and soft and I would describe the colour as mocha.  I am knitting it on 5.5mm needles (US 9).  The size will probably be around 6-12 months.  I have another <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/Jacinta7t7/pebble-henrys-manly-cobblestone-inspired-baby-vest">Pebble Vest on Ravelry</a>, that I made for Jairah, if you want to have a look.</p>

<p>I am trying to get through a book by Barbara Kingslover, The Lacuna.  I was enjoying it to start with, but I must admit I am finding it a bit long winded the further I read (I'm about half way), even though it is well written.  I usually devour Barbara books, but alas, not this one.  But I want to finish it before I start reading another book.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=754">giveaway</a> for Easter if you are interested.</p>
