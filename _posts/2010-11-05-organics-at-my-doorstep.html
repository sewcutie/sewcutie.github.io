<p>We feel very lucky indeed to have the choice of having organic fruit and vegetables <em>delivered to our door</em> every Friday.  The produce is second to non and oh so yummy.  I love that we only eat what is in season and a lot of the produce is locally grown.  Of course Jacquie, Andrew and staff of <em>Organics On Wheels</em> are great to deal with!  We have been buying our fruit and veg from them for 5 years and I can't go back to buying our produce any other way.</p>
<p>For a couple of weeks we were able to get apples that came in hessian bags, how quaint is that.  They were fuji apples to die for!</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_136" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="By the way, the tangelos were amazing!"]<a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Organicbox2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-136" title="Organicbox2" src="assets/Organicbox2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.organicsonwheels.com.au/">Here</a> is a link to Jacquie and Andrew's contact details.  Definitely worth checking out if you are within their home delivery area.  They are based in Cockatoo/Nangana, Victoria.</p>
<p>I feel by purchasing organically grown food, I am giving back to the those who are thinking beyond tomorrow.  For that is where my children are headed and I would like to think my children's future will benefit from the foresight of organic farming.</p>
<p>Disclaimer - I don't receive any kick backs for recommendations, I just believe in sharing with you, businesses that are wonderful to deal with. It's definitely a service with a smile.</p>
