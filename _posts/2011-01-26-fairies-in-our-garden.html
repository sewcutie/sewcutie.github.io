<p>Our afternoon was spent outside planting a new passionfruit vine, weeding and building a fairy house.  Well actually, Scarlett was the fairy house builder.  I think it is the most wonderful creation.  Scarlett built the fairy house the other week when Greg was building the <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=340">shed</a>.  She puts so much time and effort into every garden she builds for her fairies.  I can see our time in fairyland with Scarlett isn't going to last forever, so for these moments I am truly grateful and I cherish them dearly.</p>
<p>Her masterpiece:</p>
