<p>This is such a yummy and quick recipe.  It's about as healthy as biscuits get and made in the Thermomix, it is a breeze.  As well as being vegan, they are gluten free. They taste to me of sticky date pudding.  The biscuits are lovely and moist and I find it hard to stop at just one!  I am tempted to try and bake it in a pudding dish and see if I can make a pudding of sorts.  If I try it, I'll be sure to post about it.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>3 bananas<br />
1 cup dates<br />
1/3 cup coconut oil, NB if coconut oil is really firm, soften slightly<br />
1 tsp vanilla essence or 1/3 vanilla bean pod</p>
<p><strong>Method for Thermomix:</strong></p>
<p>place 1/3 vanilla pod in Thermomix and blend on speed 8 for 10 seconds.  Scrape down sides (if using vanilla essence, add it with the dates and coconut oil).  Add dates and coconut oil, blend on speed 5 for 5 seconds.  Add bananas and blend on speed 5 for 5 seconds.  Set aside for 15 minutes.  Place spoonfuls of mixture on a baking tray lined with baking paper and bake in oven @180 degrees celsius (375F) for 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Lovely served while still warm or let cool to room temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Conventional method:</strong></p>
<p>Chop dates finely, place in a bowl.  Mash bananas and add to the dates.  If using vanilla pod, chop finely and add the the other ingredients otherwise pour in vanilla essence.  Add coconut oil the rest of the mixture and stir well to combine.  Place spoonfuls of mixture on an oven tray lined with baking paper and bake @180 degrees celsius for 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Lovely served while still warm or cool to room temperature.</p>
