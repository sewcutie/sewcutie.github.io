<p>My cousin's wife recently had a baby girl.  What better excuse to do some crafting!  I decided that a quilt was in order.  The pattern is by Kwik Sew, pattern no. 2971.   I purchased the pattern about 8 years ago, so not sure if it is still currently available.  As per usual, I changed the pattern slightly.  The quilt could be used in a cot, on the end of a bed or even a play rug.  Welcome sweet baby!</p>
