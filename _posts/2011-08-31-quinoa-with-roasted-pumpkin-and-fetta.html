<p>We had a housewarming to go to on the weekend and I whipped up this to take along to share.  It is really yummy and I am happy to report it was devoured quickly.  The roasted pumpkin adds a lovely sweetness which compliments the saltiness of the fetta.  I used sheep's fetta, but you can use whatever fetta appeals to your taste.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>1 cup uncooked quinoa<br />
400gm pumpkin, cubed (I used kent pumpkin)<br />
90gm Sheep fetta<br />
2tsp chicken stock powder (I prefer Massel's)<br />
1 small sprig of rosemary, stem removed<br />
2 tbspn olive oil<br />
3 cups water<br />
sea salt</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Pour 3 cups of water into a saucepan and add 1 cup quinoa and chicken stock powder.  Simmer gently for approximately 15 minutes or until quinoa is just cooked through.  Remove from heat.<br />
Combine cubed pumpkin, olive oil, a pinch of sea salt and rosemary and place on a baking tray.  Roast in a moderate oven until pumpkin is golden brown and cooked through. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly.<br />
Once quinoa and pumpkin are cooled, mix together in a bowl and add crumbled fetta.  Stir through carefully to prevent everything mushing together.   Garnish as desired. Place in fridge until ready to serve.</p>
