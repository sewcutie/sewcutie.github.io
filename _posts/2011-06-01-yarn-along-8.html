<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/06/yarn-along.html">Ginny at Small Things </a>yarn along this week.</p>
<p>I have made quite a bit of progress on Scarlett's dress this week.  I have almost finished the back, just a few more rows.</p>

<p>As we are heading into winter I have re-visited one of my books, Seven Times The Sun, by Shea Darian.  I find this time of year I need to remember the I can keep the harmony in our home as the days shorten and our outside play is lessend.  This book is lovely helping you to guide your children through the rhythms of the day.  It is filled with lovely verses, songs, suggestions for stories and simple suggestions for keeping a little magic in your home life.  One of my favourite passages from the book, which comes from the section on celebrating bedtime is:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>"Mother Night, Let them run in your fields of darkness,<br />
Let them drink from the cup of your milky moon,</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Rock them in your blanket of stars,</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>And when you depart, kiss their waking souls with your wisdom."</em></strong></p>
<p>That verse always takes my breath away.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what everyone has made/read this week.  Jacinta x</p>
