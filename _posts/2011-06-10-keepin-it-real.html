<p>Just thought I would share a snippet of my morning with you.  While I was tidying up in another room, Jairah took great joy in emptying clean washing out of baskets (folded and unfolded) and repurposing the baskets into trains.  He sure knows how to find the fun (and comfort) in life.  It makes for finding the pairs to sock easier too!</p>

<p>Do you have little laundry helpers too?  Jacinta x</p>
