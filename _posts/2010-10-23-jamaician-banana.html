<p>Oh my goodness.  This is one of these toppings for pancakes or crepes that makes my mouth water.  I haven't shared this one before, but I feel it is blog worthy!</p>
<p>Ingredients -</p>
<p>2 bananas - chopped into 1cm pieces<br />
butter<br />
brown sugar<br />
cream<br />
dark rum - optional (but this is where the flavour lies) or non alcoholic substitute</p>
