<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/04/yarn-along_27.html">Ginny at Small Things </a>yarn along this week.</p>
<p>I have finally finished the pebble vest.  I am happy with how it has turned out.  Now for the fun part, I am giving away the vest!</p>
<p>I would size the vest between 6-12months, however, all babies are different sizes, so it is only an estimate.  It measures 9.5" or 23.5 cm across and 11" or 28cm from back of neck to hemline.  The buttons down the side are made of coconut and the heart buttons on the shoulder are wooden.  It is a wool/soya blend yarn.  The colour in the second photo is the most correct.  It's mocha in colour.  It is really dark here today, so not great for photos (in fact it has been snowing just up the road from us).  It would suit either a boy or a girl.  I will leave comments open until Friday 13th (I'm sure that means good luck!).  Entry is open to international lovelies too.   <strong>Please mention in the comment section if you want to be entered into the draw.</strong></p>

<p>Now to start thinking about my next project.  As for what I am reading, I am still plugging away at The Lacuna.  I don't get a lot of reading time at the moment so only reading a few pages before going to bed.  At this rate, I will be reading it for the rest of the year!   Looking forward to seeing what everyone else is up to.  Jacinta x</p>
