<p>Every time I make this, I am asked for the recipe.  I therefore deem it worthy of posting here.  Inspiration for this recipe came from the recipe book called RAWvolution, written by Matt Amsden.  I didn't have all the ingredients called for, so in my tradition, altered the recipe to the ingredients I did have.</p>
<p>A word of warning - it is very hard to stop at one piece!</p>
<p><strong>For pie crust-</strong></p>
<p>2 cups raw almonds</p>
<p>1/3-1/2 cup maple syrup</p>
<p><strong>For pie filling -</strong></p>
<p>1/2 cup saltanas or 1/2 cup pitted prunes</p>
<p>1/3 cup desiccated coconut</p>
<p>1/2 cup pecan nuts</p>
<p>1/3-1/2 cup water</p>
<p><strong>Method -</strong></p>
<p>Process almonds and maple syrup on food processor until they resemble bread crumbs. Press into shallow dish (approximately 20cm). Place ingredients for filling into food processor and mix until well combined.  Adjust water quantity if need be.  Spread over base. Refrigerate until serving.</p>
