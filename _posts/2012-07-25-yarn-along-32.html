<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/07/yarn-along-87.html">Ginny</a> from Small Things this week.</p>
<p>I am happy to say I have finished my Puerperium.  I love how it has knitted up, even if it is still a little bigger than intended, but then it will fit longer won't it!  I found the perfect buttons while out for a friends birthday earlier this week.  The yarn is made by Bendigo Woollen Mills, Luxury 8ply in Lake.  It's so soft and buttery, very hard to believe it is 100% pure wool.  It's perfect for babies.</p>

<p>As for my Tea Leaves cardi, I now have both sleeves knitted, just the button bands and I'm done.  Hopefully I'll have pictures next week.  I have started a new project for a friend's birthday gift.  It will be based on <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/a-grey-loop">this</a> pattern.  The yarn is lovely and soft.  I'm already 4 rows in, after casting it on this afternoon.  So I should have it knitted up pretty quick.</p>

<p>I finished, The Year The Horses Came, by Mary Mackey.  While it was an ok read, it was pretty full on in places, not for those who don't like gruesome scenes.  Of course, it has ended on a bit of a cliff hanger, so I will have to read the next book to find out what happens next and being a trilogy, probably all three books!  I think I need a change for the time being though, I have been searching for something else to read, but haven't found anything that grabs me so far.  Will be seeing what you are all recommending.</p>
