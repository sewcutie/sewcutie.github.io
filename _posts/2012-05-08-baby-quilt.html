<p>You might remember my little sneak peek of a project I was working on last week, well it was for some friend's of ours who recently had a sweet little baby boy.  Baby's mama appreciates handmade items, so I knew a baby quilt was in order.  I bought the fabric from my favourite Australia quilt store <a href="http://www.wantitneeditquilt.com.au/">wantitneeditquiltit</a>.  Jane, is so lovely to deal with and her prices are fantastic!  I love the colours in the fabric and as always, moda fabric is of great quality.  The fabric was actually purchase as a quilt kit that Jane had designed, but me, in my usual craft craziness, knew that I'd no hope in finishing the quilt in time if I had to do the aplique that was part of the original design (I only had a week to get the quilt finished with very limited time).  So I just added an extra row of charm squares to the pattern and omitted the lollypop aplique.  However, Jane's instructions for the pattern are very precise,  so I have no hesitation in recommending the <a href="http://www.wantitneeditquilt.com.au/lollipop-quilt-kit/">original pattern.</a></p>

<p>I certainly enjoyed having a gorgeous little boy to hold, who happily slept his time away in my arms.  I'm so hopeless when it comes to babies, cluck, cluck, cluck!  I certainly feel like a little piece of me always goes with a gift I have made and I hope little baby 'A' enjoys his quilt for many years to come.  I have a little something for their daughter too, but it is still in the throws of being finished.  I will share a picture once I have finished big sister's gift (cause we all know big-little siblings are special too).</p>
