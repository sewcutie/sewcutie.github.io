<p>I just had one of those moments.  I left a comment in another blog as the writer was talking about how embarrassed she was about the state of her old wallet.  I had a giggle, not at her, but at the state of my own wallet.  It has served me well for many years, about 15 actually, but then of course the zipper broke a few years ago.  No worries, I just started using a separate coin purse.  Then there is the fact that the card section is so loose after many years of <del datetime="2011-03-10T07:06:53+00:00">stuffing</del> putting my cards in it, that the cards practically go flying everywhere when I am at the supermarket.  But lets face it, I donate so much of our funds to the supermarket (for not a lot), they may as well have all my cards.  Anyway, after I had left the comment on her blog, I went to get a drink and remembered there was a package that arrived for me today that I hadn't yet opened.  I opened it up and along with a gorgeous card, a dear friend of mine (I shall refer to her as A) had sent me (you guessed yet?) a new wallet!  Cue the sci-fi music.  The wallet is adorable, but I can help but feel a little weirded out, but in a good way of course.  Thanks A, you are divine!
