<p>Jairah and I have been feeling a bit under the weather the last couple of days.  I always crave chicken soup when unwell.  This is a really basic recipe that tastes SO good.  The delicious flavour comes from the homemade stock and the cumin adds a nice edge.  It is made in two stages.  Of course you don't have to feel unwell to enjoy the goodness.</p>
<p><strong>Chicken Stock</strong></p>
<p>1 whole chicken<br />
1 onion - peeled and roughly chopped into 4<br />
Enough water to cover chicken<br />
1 tbsp oil</p>
<p>In a large pot fry the onion with the oil for a couple of minutes then add the whole chicken.  Lightly brown on both sides (this is what will add the colour to your soup). Be careful not to burn the onion or chicken.  Pour in enough water to cover the chicken.  Place lid ajar on pot and gently boil for a couple of hours.  Turn off heat and when cool enough, place in fridge.  Leave overnight for better flavour.<br />
The next day remove from fridge and skim off any reside on the surface and disgard.  Remove the chicken and strip the meat off the bone.  Chop up the meat and discard the skin and bones.  Drain off stock liquid through a sieve into a bowl and put aside.   Discard the cooked onion.</p>
<p><strong>To make soup</strong></p>
<p>1 onion, chopped finely<br />
1 1/2  tsp cumin powder<br />
Chicken stock liquid<br />
Chopped chicken meat - use as much or little as desired<br />
Flavour to taste (I personally prefer Massels brand of chicken stock powder or Celtic salt)<br />
Cream optional</p>
<p>In a large pot add oil and chopped onion.  Cook onion until transparent.  Add cumin and stir for a minute.  Add chicken meat and stock liquid.  Heat until gently simmering.  Season to taste. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes.  Serve into bowls and add a dollop of cream if desired.  Enjoy!</p>
