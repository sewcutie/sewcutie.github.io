<p>The new kitchen arrived today, flat packed.  Of course we were lead to believe that there would be two people unloading it, but no, just one.  I ended up having to help unload lots of pieces, some pretty heavy, so I am feeling it tonight.  I won't complain too much, as I have been looking forward to this dream kitchen for some time.  Now for the fun part, putting the pieces together.  It's one big jigsaw really.  We are just hoping there are some instructions in one of the boxes!  I'll leave that one for Greg and his dad to puzzle over.</p>

<p>It will be very interesting getting by without a kitchen for at least the next 2 1/2 weeks and with at least 7 people to cater for, I will hopefully continue to be creative with meals. Hmm, let's see.</p>
