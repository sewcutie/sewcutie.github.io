<p>What a wonderful few days I have had.  My birthday was on Saturday, but we started celebrating the night before with Greg and I going out to dinner to a favourite restaurant.  It was such a treat to go out, just the two of us, to sit and chat and enjoy food I didn't have to prepare.  Now it wasn't just any meal either,  I'm talking, eyes-rolling-into-back-of-your-head kind.  Now my mouth is watering, just thinking about it.  If you are ever in the Dandenong Ranges, I can highly recommend <a href="http://www.coonarasprings.com.au/">Coonara Springs Restaurant</a>.</p>

<p>Saturday lunch was spent with some of my gorgeous friends at a local cafe.  We throughly enjoyed our time with much talk and a lot of laughter.  I think we need to get together more often.  After lunch we wondered to a near by yarn shop (what a coincidence) and I found the perfect button for my newly finished cowl (pics to come).  None of us were in a hurry to return to reality, so we all went back to my place for another cuppa and more talk (about knitting of course).  Many thanks to Greg, who had 5 kids in his care for the duration of our extended lunch.</p>

<p>Scarlett and Tenneille spent a good portion of Saturday afternoon decorating the birthday cake.  They were even fighting over the privilege at one stage, and then, of course, there were tears, ho hum.  I'm sure we could be part of a reality tv program at times!  But after all that, Scarlett has declared she wants the same cake for her birthday next year.  So it couldn't be all bad.</p>

<p>Sunday was Mother's Day, so my family got to spread the love a little longer.  I enjoyed breakfast in bed and the girls made me special cards.  My day was mostly spent knitting, so what more could I have asked for.  Well ok, I'm thinking of getting Knit Pick interchangeable needles and some yarn to make <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/tea-leaves-cardigan">Tea Leaves cardigan</a>.  I bought the pattern for Tea Leaves 3 years ago, so I think it's time I actually cast it on!  I'm thinking I might knit it in charcoal or maybe red.  Decisions, decisions.</p>
<p>Today I am feeling very blessed to have such wonderful friends and my sweet little family to make celebrating another year so very special.  If you were celebrating Mother's Day this past weekend, I hope you felt the love and honour, because you are so worth it you gorgeous women.  Jacinta xx</p>
