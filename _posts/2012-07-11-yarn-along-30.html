<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/07/yarn-along-85.html">Ginny</a> at Small Things.</p>
<p>Well I have made a little more progress with my Tea Leaves cardi.  I now have one sleeve! I made a start on a Beyond Puerperium for a friend's baby and it has been knitting up beautifully, but it is sizing up HUGE!  I tried it on Jairah who is 3 and it fits him, it's meant to be 3-6month in size.  I have put it aside and will try knitting another Puerperium but I'll try the newborn size.  Has anyone else found the Puerperium runs on the large size?  I have used the yarn and needle size the pattern calls for.  Oh well, looks like Jairah will score himself a new outfit.  The yarn is by Bendigo Woollen Mills from their Rustic line in Elm, which I would describe as a lovely grey/green.  Thankfully when I originally ordered the yarn for this project, I could decided between Elm and another yarn colour, Lake blue, so I got them both.  Looks like the baby will be geting a lovely blue Puerperium instead!</p>

<p>I am reading The Year The Horses Came, by Mary Mackey.  It is the first book in the Earthsong trilogy.  Based back in ancient times, it is based on a girl, Marrah, who only knows peaceful living.  Her people worship Goddess Earth.  She has a vision of terrible beastmen invading their peaceful living and sets off accompanied by her brother, Arang, and Stavan, a man who she rescued from near death, to warn a priestess in a faraway city of the possible attack from the beastmen.  I'm only half way through, so the storyline is still unfolding.  I'm liking it so far.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing all your gorgeous knitting and hearing about what everyone is reading.  Jacinta x</p>
