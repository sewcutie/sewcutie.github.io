<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/05/yarn-along-79.html">Ginny</a> from Small Things</p>
<p>I am excited to say Jairah's Askel vest is off the needles.  I didn't need to block it much and it fits him beautifully.  It worked out about a size 4 which is what I was hoping for.  I can't say that Askel is the best written pattern I have had to follow.  Maybe a little was lost in translation?  Thankfully I was able to mull through the pattern and work out what I needed to do.  I did use 8 ply and 3.75mm and 4mm needles which was different to what the pattern called for, so made my own little changes along the way.  The yarn I used was Moda Vera Pure wool.  I was a little splitty, but has washed up beautifully with a lovely silky feeling.  The stripes were done using scraps of wool I had in my stash.  Speaking of stripes, as the vest is knitted in the round, I wanted to avoid the 'jog' that can occur when you change colours for knitting stripes.  Watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PjA0IR0MOU">this video</a> was a great help and so simple.  I'm sure some of you already know the trick, but for those who don't, it is worth watching.</p>

<p>I cast on my Tea Leaves cardi tonight.  I am loving the yarn I ordered.  It is the most beautiful ruby colour and feels lovely and soft.  I ordered it through <a href="http://www.bendigowoollenmills.com.au/">Bendigo Woollen Mills</a> and their delivery was quick.  I love that is in made here in Victoria with Australia wool too.</p>

<p>As for reading.  I just started reading a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Keeper-People-Book-One-ebook/dp/B0055HYNH4/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338372758&amp;sr=1-1">Keeper of the People</a>, by Karah Quinney.  I can't tell you much about it, as I have only read a few pages, but so far, so good.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing what you have all been crafting and reading too.  Jacinta x</p>
