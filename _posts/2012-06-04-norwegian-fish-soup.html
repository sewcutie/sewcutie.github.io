<p>I just have to share this recipe with you.  Alas, it isn't my own but it can be found <a href="http://transplantedbaker.typepad.com/the_transplanted_baker/2012/01/creamy-norwegian-fish-soup.html">here</a>.  It is so tasty.  For my version of the soup I used a combination of 500gm of salmon and 500gm blue grenadire for the white fish.  Blue grenadire holds its shape well when cooked, so won't go too flaky in the soup.  A couple of potatoes were added in with the leek and the carrots.  Greg and I ate it for a few meals and it improved in flavour the following day.  So if you find yourself in need of some warming, comforting soul food, this is it.</p>
