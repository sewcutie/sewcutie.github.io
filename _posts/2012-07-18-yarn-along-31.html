<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/07/yarn-along-86.html">Ginny</a> from Small Things.</p>
<p>I have put aside my Beyond Puerperium from last week to finish for Jairah at a later date.  I have cast on another in a smaller size.  It does seem to be a pattern that runs on the large side.  I know my gauge is right.  I am knitting the 0-3 month size and it looks closer to 6 months, which should be fine for my friend's baby, as I am aiming for it to fit for the coming European winter.  I'm using Bendigo Woollen Mills luxury 8ply in Lake.  It's a lovely grey/blue and buttery soft.</p>

<p>As for reading, I have dug out one of my Barbara Kingsolver books, Small Wonder.  I'm looking forward to reading it again.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what you have all be crafting this week.  Jacinta x</p>
