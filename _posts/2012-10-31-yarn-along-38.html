<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/10/yarn-along-100.html">Ginny</a> from Small Things.</p>
<p>I am only four rows in with the <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1912">Sweet Memories Cowl</a> I started last week.  It is a fast knit once cast on, that is if I find the time to knit!  I need to get it done quickly though, as my list of Christmas gifts to make grows by the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/yarnalong31oct.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2072" title="yarnalong31oct" src="assets/yarnalong31oct.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>I finished the book I was reading last week, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Last-Duchess-ebook/dp/B0049MPKGO/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351675069&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=my+last+duchess">My Last Duchess</a> by Daisy Goodwin (also know as The American Heiress).  To be honest, towards the end I was reading it just to find out the ending, as it was dragging on a little for my liking.  Thankfully the ending did sum up a few things for me.  I found it hard not to feel frustrated with the characters and their behaviour in the book at times, but I just keep reminding myself that choices were so limited for women back in the 1880's, no matter what their financial or social status was.  Let alone the fact, you couldn't speak your mind in most situations.  One good insight in regards to this was between Cora and her maid, Bertha and how Bertha's life is so heavily moulded by Cora's.  I loved the descriptions of the houses in the book.  I am such a sucker for old houses and their estates.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what you have all been crafting and reading this week.</p>
