<p>So as we are getting closer to Christmas, the realisation that I have done very little, albiet, nothing for Christmas is a little daunting.  But of course there are always books that inspire the crafter within me.</p>
<p>Sew Soft Toys by Karin Neuschutz is one of them.  It has been translated into english.  The patterns are easy to follow and the toys are just gorgeous. Here is a <a href="http://www.winterwoodtoys.com.au/shop/scdproducts.asp?CatID=72">link</a> to the book.  I made Tenneille an elephant out of the book for her birthday last year using some funky fabric I picked up at an op shop.  Tenneille loves 'Eli' and they have been on many grand adventures together.  Scarlett has been patiently waiting for me to finish making a horse from this book.  I have cut it out, it just needs stitching!!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>I recently ordered Homemade Beginnings by Anna Maria Horner.  It is full of beautiful sewing projects for babies and mother's to be.  I haven't made anything from it yet, but the cute-as-a-button baby booties are on my 'must sew' list.  Along with the Quick change trousers for Jairah, oh and Henny Penny and her six chicks are pretty darn cute too.  I could go on, but I would be listing practically everything in the book!  Anna Maria's fabrics are divine to too.  I purchased my copy through <a href="http://www.fishpond.com.au/Books/Home_Garden/Crafts_Hobbies/Sewing/9780470497814/?cf=3&amp;rid=696633348&amp;i=1&amp;keywords=handmade+beginning">Fishpond</a>.</p>

<p>Creative Play for your toddler by Christopher Clouder and Janni Nicol is another favourite.  I have made the bunny out of this book quite a few times.  I am always impressed how a square of knitting transforms into the cutest of bunnies and all of them seem to have their own personalities.  Jairah's has one floppy ear!  They make up very quickly and I have been know for making them the night before a birthday.<br />
The fishing set is pretty sweet too.  I have actually cut out fish to make this, but they seem to have disappeared into my craft stash somewhere.  I am sure I will come across them when looking for something else!  The Parachute people and wind wand are also worth a look.<br />
This book also goes into the importance of creative and imaginative play for toddlers through a Steiner/Waldorf perspective.  It really is a lovely book.  I can't remember where I purchased this, may have been Amazon?</p>
