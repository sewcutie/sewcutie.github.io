<p>So it seems I bit off more than I can chew this week (what's new) and found myself with a gift to make the <em>day </em>of a birthday party.  It was my Godson's birthday this week and we spent today with him and his lovely family having lots of fun.  As part of his gift I bought a tee-shirt from Target and Tenneille chose the moster material from Spotlight.  I cut out three monsters for the front and one for the back.  I attached them to the tee-shirt with Heat-n-bond and sewed around the edges with the sewing machine, to keep them in place.  For the card I also cut out a monster and attached it in the same manner as above, to a piece of cardboard.</p>

<p>It was very well received and I plan to make two more for up coming birthdays.  It took about half an hour to complete.  The ideal gift to make the morning of a birthday, or perhaps a couple of days before might be more ideal (but who am I kidding).  Jacinta x</p>
