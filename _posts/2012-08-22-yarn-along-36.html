<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/08/yarn-along-90.html">Ginny</a> from Small Things.</p>
<p>Still knitting away on the Beyond Puerperium.  I have finished the body, just deciding if I will do short or long sleeves, then some buttons need to be picked out.</p>
<p>I have some lovely Noro that I have recently added to my stash.  I few weeks back,  I thought I had lost Jairah's knitted hat and after searching for over a week, decided to buy some more yarn to make another.  Can you guess where this is going?  Of course, after buying the Noro (costs a small fortune over here), I found his hat.  It had been put up on top of a cupboard and obviously I hadn't looked that high up!  Anyway, now I need to find a project to use the two balls of Noro.  Maybe another cowl?  Not sure yet.  May look at Ravelry for some inspiration.</p>

<p>As for reading.  I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kashmir-Shawl-Rosie-Thomas/dp/0007285965/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345629891&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+kashmir+shawl">The Kashmir Shawl</a>, by Rosie Thomas.  I can't say I loved the book, maybe liked?  I found myself reading it, just to finish it.  I think it had too much in the way of affairs outside of marriages for me to find the book captivating, more sad if anything.  Anyway, I bought another book on Kindle this week, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fields-Corn-Amish-Lancaster-ebook/dp/B0011DR58A/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345630526&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fields+of+corn+kindle+edition">Fields of Corn</a> by Sarah Price.  It's a good old Amish story, so should be quite a contrast from The Kashmir Shawl!  I've only just started it, so haven't formed an opinion on it so far.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what you have all been creating this week.  Jacinta x</p>
