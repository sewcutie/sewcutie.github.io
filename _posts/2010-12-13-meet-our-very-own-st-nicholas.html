<p>Saint Nicholas joined our family a few years back.  I love his rustic look and charm.  I made him from a pattern out of Australia Homespun, No.12 (Vol 3.4).  It is a fairly old magazine.  I had it a few years before making St Nick.  He wore a beard of inferior quality for a couple of years, until I stumbled upon some lovely natural woollen fleece.  It looks and feels so much better than his previous beard did.  I love him dearly!</p>

<p>I have made a lovely little tradition each Christmas where I read a story of St Nicholas to the children, with him sitting at our side of course.</p>
