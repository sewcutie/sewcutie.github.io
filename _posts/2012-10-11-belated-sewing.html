<p>I had all good intentions of a gifting Jairah at least one thing for his birthday, but alas he has been quite unwell with one evening last week spent in the ER!  Thankfully he seems to be better this week and I am slowly catching up on the backlog of domestic duties after having my arms busy hugging an unwell boy.</p>
<p>I've chosen to make the bucket hat out of Oliver + S, Little Things To Sew book by Liesl Gibson.  Jairah loves The Very Hungry Catterpillar book, so when I found the fabric at Spotlight a couple of weeks ago, I bought it, well I should say Jairah saw it and didn't want to leave without it.  I figured he could do with another hat for the coming summer and I can imagine he will be keen to wear it.  I've made a start, and as per all the patterns in the book, it is pretty straight forward.  Fingers crossed I will get it finished in the next few days.  In other sewing news, I have finished the picnic quilt I talked about recently.  Now just waiting for a dry and sunny day to take pictures.</p>
