<p>I just know you <em>need</em> another chocolate cake recipe.  I came up with this recipe the other day.  It is quick and easy to prepare.  We have worked our way through this cake over the weekend and it seems to keep very well.  I hope you try it out.  I promise you won't regret it!  In fact, I baked another one tonight for guests coming tomorrow.  I'm trying not to go and cut a slice while it is still warm (cue me eyes rolling back into my head!).</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>3 eggs<br />
1/2 cup brown sugar<br />
1/3 cup castor sugar<br />
2/3 cup cocoa powder<br />
200gm dark chocolate, chopped roughly<br />
150gm butter<br />
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped roughly<br />
1/4 cup cream<br />
1/2 cup plain flour<br />
1/2 tsp cream of tartar<br />
1/4 tsp bi-carb soda (baking soda)<br />
1 tsp vanilla extract/essence</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p>Place butter and 100gm chocolate in a saucepan and melt over a low heat.  Take off heat and set aside.  Sift all dry ingredients into a bowl.  Add cream and vanilla essence to the melted butter and chocolate.  Making sure the chocolate mixture has cooled, pour it into dry ingredients and stir through.  Add beaten eggs and stir until combined.  Add chopped nuts and the other 100gm of chopped chocolate.<br />
Mix until combined and pour into a well greased cake tin (approximately 20cm diameter) lined with baking paper.  Place cake in a pre-heated oven on approximately 160 degrees celsius for about 45 mins or until cooked through.  Leave to cool before turning the cake out.  Dust with icing sugar and serve with strawberries if desired.</p>
