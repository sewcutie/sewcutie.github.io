<p>fall asleep very early!<br />
We went to a BBQ on Sunday afternoon hosted by my dad and his partner.  A few of her grandkids are similar in age to our kids.  Tenneille buddied up with one in particular who is the same age as her.  They insisted on having a sleepover.  Apparently they were still awake at 1am the next morning talking and having a wonderful time.  Come 5pm yesterday, Tenneille had crashed out on the couch.  She slept until 6.30am this morning.  She took no rocking to fall aleep tonight either.</p>
