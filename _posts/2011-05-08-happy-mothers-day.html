<p>What a lovely day I have had with my sweet little family.  I got lots of cuddles followed by breakfast in bed.</p>

<p>I got handmade cards and the girls wrapped the presents themselves.  I love how proud they were of their work.</p>

<p>We had plans to go and visit a local garden, but the day turned out to be wet and quite foggy.  We spent a busy day at home instead.  My heart is full to the point it could burst with the love I have for this family of mine.  I am blessed.  I hope you had a beautiful day too.  Jacinta x</p>
