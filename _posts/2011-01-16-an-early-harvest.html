<p>With all the wet weather we have had here, combined with an army of snails that made a meal of my potato leaves, I had to harvest my potatoes early.  While there might not be enough to sustain us for any great length of time,they were organically grown.  Here is a <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=106">past post</a> featuring the spuds in their glory days.  My veggie patch is still a work in progress due to inclimate weather!   Hope your veggie garden is doing better than mine.  I won't even get started on the apples.</p>
