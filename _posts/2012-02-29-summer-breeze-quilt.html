<p>A little over a year ago, I purchased some gorgeous fabric designed by Sweetwater called Sun Kissed and their quilt pattern called Summer Breeze.  I knew it would be fitting for Tenneille.  Originally I was going to make the quilt for her 5th birthday, but of course, that didn't happen, however, it was completed in time for her 6th birthday.  I worked on it over about a period of about 5 months, in between other projects.  I ended up adding an extra border to the outside edge, as the original pattern was a little on the small side for a single bed quilt.  The finished size is approximately 55"x55".  I could have made it a fraction bigger again, but I didn't have enough material.  Still, it sits nicely on her bed and compliments her curtains and wall colour.   The fabric quality is excellent and the colours are just divine.  I must admit, Moda fabric is now one of my favourites.  I originally purchased the pattern and fabric from <a href="http://www.fatquartershop.com/">The Fat Quater</a> shop.</p>

<p>I still have enough fabric to make up a cushion cover or two, hopefully I can do that before she turns 7!</p>
