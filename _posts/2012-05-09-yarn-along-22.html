<p>Following along with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/05/yarn-along-76.html">Ginny</a> at Small Things.</p>
<p>Well my Fear Of Commitment Cowl is off the needles.  The loose ends are now woven in, just need to pick out a button and it's finished.  I'm happy with how it has turned out and can't wait to wear it.  The pattern is easy enough for a beginner knitter to attempt, as there are only two lines of repeat to make the seeded rib stitch. The yarn is from my stash, made by Moda Vera and is labeled Mousse.  I'd describe the colour as peacock blue. It has a lovely richness to it and is a blend of wool and soya with an uneven weave to it that resembles hand spun yarn.</p>

<p>As for reading.  I've had a book on my bedside table for months that I think I will read this week.  It's called A Love Like Ours, by Rosie Harris.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what you have all been creating this week.  Jacinta x</p>
