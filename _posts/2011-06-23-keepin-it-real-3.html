<p><em>- Keepin' It Real captures the true essence of family life that I know are fleeting, keeping this mama grounded -</em></p>
<p>As we are in the midst of renovating, different rooms get reassigned their use.  The playroom is currently also Scarlett's bedroom.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/keepinitreal23june.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979" title="keepinitreal23june" src="assets/keepinitreal23june.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>It seems a bed in the middle of the room makes for fun play and jumping on and off of course.   So while the playroom is in shambles, Scarlett's room is getting its finishing touches before Greg starts on the floating floors.  The house is definitely a work in progress.</p>
<p>I hope if you have renovated with kids, it has been a mostly fun journey!  Jacinta x</p>
