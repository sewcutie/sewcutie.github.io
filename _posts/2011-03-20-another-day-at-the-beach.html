<p>Scarlett had <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=208">Nippers</a> yesterday.  Which mean a lovely afternoon spent at the beach.  The weather was perfect, not too hot, not too cold.  Jairah and Tenneille loved walking around in the shallows of the bay.</p>

<p>Scarlett looks like a pro now on the body board.  Unfortunately I only had my phone so couldn't get a good photo to show you.  I think I ended up with about 50 shells in my pocket that were gifts from Tenneille.  Each one she gave me, she promised was the last one, but of course there was always 'one more' that she liked 'the best'.</p>

<p>We enjoyed good olde fish and chips afterwards before all heading home happy, but weary.  We were told by one of the group leaders that Scarlett has improved the most overall in the group.  Now trying not to get a big head, but we have noticed how far she has come too and we are so proud of her efforts.  We only have 2 more weeks to go before the season ends.  It has been a fun journey.</p>
