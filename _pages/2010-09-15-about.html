<p>Welcome!  I'm Jacinta, mama to three gorgeous wee ones, Scarlett, Tenneille and Jairah, wife to Greg.  We are an Australia family who have just recently relocated to Boston, Ma. Looking forward to our expat life and enjoying all the fun adventures that await us in our new country.</p>
<p>Our lives are busy, fun and often crazy, but would have it no other way.</p>
<p>So pour yourself a cuppa, take a seat and follow along as we explore the US.</p>
<p>Happy days,</p>
<p>Jacinta x</p>
