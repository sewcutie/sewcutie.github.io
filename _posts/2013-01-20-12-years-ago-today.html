<p>Greg and I celebrated our 12th wedding anniversary today.  Just seems like yesterday! Nothing like celebrating with leftovers for dinner, after a crazy busy day in the garden getting things organised after being away for a month.  We went to New Zealand to spend Christmas with Greg's family.  A post to come about our adventures.  So many things to share, when I find the time.  I hope all my loyal readers have had a lovely festive season and you are enjoying the fresh beginnings of a new year.  I hope I won't be too absent from this space, I've missed you all.</p>

<p>Looking back at these pictures, I wish we could relive the day.  Was such a fun day surrounded by some pretty special people.  Jacinta x</p>
