<p>We celebrated Father's Day this past Sunday.  Greg got a 'sleep in' (ok, I think it was more along the lines of being jumped on by Jairah), while I cooked us a hearty breakfast.  The girls had lovingly wrapped his presents and made him gorgeous cards.  A picnic has been on the cards all week and thankfully the weather gods were smiling upon us making a picnic possible.  I can't tell you how good the warm sun felt on our faces.  Isn't it amazing how a little sunshine, blue sky and fresh air can make all the difference.  We were lucky enough to find a picnic spot with table and seats, although the girls would have preferred a picnic rug, but alas, we don't have one currently.  Although, that is my next craft project!</p>

<p>After lunch, we wondered around the gardens and just enjoyed our time together.  We love this papa of ours dearly and he works hard and certainly deserved a day devoted to him.  It couldn't have had a more perfect day.  If you celebrated Father's Day, I hope it was a lovely day too.</p>
