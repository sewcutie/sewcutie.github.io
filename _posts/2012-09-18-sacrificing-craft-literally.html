<p>I'd been thinking about writing this post most of the day.  I was so exited that you would be getting a sneak peak of my next craft project.  A good part of an hour placing was spent arranging pieces of fabric that were to become a picnic quilt.  I managed to take a few in progress photos before heading out the door for the school run.  My hopes were high that on my return home, I could work on the final layout and take more photos for reference of fabric placement, before beginning on sewing.<br />
Of course the evening had other ideas, which means the fabric was left lying unattended during the period of time dinner was being made and helping the girls with homework.  Can you guess where this is going?  Hmm, yes my dear sweet son thought I might like a modern take on fabric reconstruction and quite happily rearranged my quilt into a pile in the middle of the room.  Perhaps this is the new 'modern' quilting.  I should glue it on canvas and sell it as a form of artwork.  I'd definitely have a lot more completed craft projects to show you!  Suffice to say, the pile of fabric still lying on the floor.  I will face it tomorrow with fresh eyes and hopefully start again.  Perhaps my second design will be better than the first, that's if the day doesn't have other plans for my time.  Suffice to say, this was originally going to be titled "What Do You Sacrifice For Craft", but alas "Sacrificing Craft" seems more appropriate.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm interested, what do you sacrifice for your craft?  I'm hoping not your sanity. Jacinta x</p>
