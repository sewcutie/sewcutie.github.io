<p>I have needed (yes NEEDED) to add to my fabric stash for some time.  I have recently ordered some of the gorgeous Far, Far away II fabric by Heather Ross.  I love it so much.   Now the hardest thing is, what I am going to make it into?  Perhaps a quilt, a cushion, some clothing or maybe a bag or two. I am waiting (not so patiently now) for a copy of Oliver + S's new book, Little Things To Sew, to turn up.  I'm sure there will be something in there that would suit the fabric too.  Oh, decisions, decisions.  I also received some Sherbet Pips charm square too.  It is such a cute collection.</p>
<p>What are some of your favourite fabric designs/designers?  I love Kate Spain (although I haven't purchased any of her designs, yet, Central Park is gorgeous), Anna Maria Horner, Sweetwater, Heather Ross of course,  Sherbet Pips by Aneela Hoey, Amy Butler.</p>
<p>I find there are always too many gorgeous designs released at the same time and I have barely enough time to compete even one project before the designs I love become unavailable.  I'm sure there must be others that feel the same way.</p>
