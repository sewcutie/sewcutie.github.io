<p>This is an all time favourite of mine.  It brings back memories of sitting in my nana's kitchen, enjoying every flavoursome mouthful of homemade soupy goodness.  I loved nana's soup so much, I requested it every time we went to visit.  She always made the same soup and I never tired of it, ah yes, food for the soul.  Nana used to add a few more ingredients, but I have simplified the recipe over the years without compromising the flavour.</p>
<p>I have made this recipe both on the stove top and using the slow cooker.  The slow cooker certainly produces a more flavoursome soup.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>2 lamb shanks<br />
2 onions, coarsely chopped<br />
2 cloves garlic, crushed<br />
2-4 carrots, depending on size, coarsely chopped<br />
6 celery stems, coarsely chopped<br />
1/2 cup pearl barley<br />
stock powder to taste<br />
approximately 3 litres water<br />
1 tbsp oil<br />
(cream optional)</p>
<p><strong>Method for slow cooker:<br />
</strong>Cooking time may vary depending on individual slow cookers</p>
<p>place oil and onions in a pan and cook for 2 minutes.  Add lamb shanks and brown slightly.  Place onions and lamb shank into slow cooker along with the other ingredients, except pearl barley.  Pour in water.  Cook on high for approximately 6 hours.  (I often put the soup on in the evening and cook on low overnight for approximately 8-10 hours).</p>
<p>Carefully remove lamb shanks, ensuring there is no bone left in slow cooker.  Cut off meat and set aside.  With a slotted spoon, scoop out most of the veggies.  When cooled slightly, place them in a food processor and blend until smooth.  Add the blended veggies back into the soup along with the meat and pearl barley.  Continue to cook until barley is tender.  Add stock powder to taste.  Serve with buttered toast if desired.  For a creamy soup, once served, add a dollop of cream.</p>
<p><strong>Method for stove top:</strong></p>
<p>Add oil and onions to a large pot.  Cook for 2 minutes.  Add lamb shanks and brown on all sides.  Add the garlic, carrots and celery.  Pour in water and simmer soup for at least 1-2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Carefully remove lamb shanks, making sure no bones are left behind.  Once cool enough, cut off meat and set aside.</p>
