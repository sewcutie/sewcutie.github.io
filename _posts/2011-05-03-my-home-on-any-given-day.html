<p>They say a picture tells a thousand words.  Or should that be, a picture shows a thousand messes to be cleaned up?  I think we have a speed reader on our hands, the rate these books hit the floor!  But he is sweetness and light and cop the body language.  Priceless.</p>

<p>And yes, my home does look like this on any given day, but just to keep it fun, the location varies.  Jacinta x</p>
