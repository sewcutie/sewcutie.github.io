<p>Hi to you all and welcome to 2012!  I hope you have all had a wonderful festive season and a most happy new year.  I had an impromptu getaway with the kids while Greg was getting on top of some renovations (I wonder if they will ever end!).  Thank you to all of you who inquired after my health.  I am happy to say I am fully recovered.  I will be back in this space soon to share our adventures with you.  Until then, sending you the best of wishes for a happy and prosperous 2012!</p>
