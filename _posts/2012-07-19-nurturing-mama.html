<p>As mothers, our primary role is to nurture, but we all know that if we don't nurture ourselves too, then it often leads to feeling rundown and I'm sure at times, discontent.  I know I am guilty of this and it's often when I am totally worn out, that I realise I haven't been true to myself.  I had let my yoga practice slip and was feeling tired, sore and discontent.  It was starting to flow through the family and I realised it was only going to start changing if I was willing to change my ways.  I went out and bought myself a new yoga mat, as my old one had been partially eaten by a toddler.  Actually, said toddler did me a favour because my new mat is fantastic.  I don't think the lady who served me in the shop believed me at first that my old mat was missing a very large chunk due to a sweet little blonde child.  In fact she commented that that was 'the best one' she had heard yet!  Then she had a good giggle.</p>
<p>Already my mind is feeling quieter, I am achieving more in my days and sleeping more peacefully.  I often don't get to do my yoga until the kids are in bed, but I know I have it to look forward to during the day.  It is amazing how much more harmonious the family is in the short time since I began doing yoga again.  My patience is restored and I am finding so much more joy in my day.</p>
<p>What do you do for yourself, to help you get through your day?</p>
