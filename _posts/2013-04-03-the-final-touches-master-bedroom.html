<p>Hello my dear readers, that is if you are still with me.  We have been so busy getting this house ready to put on the market, that my little space here has suffered.  We officially signed the papers today to initiate the sale of our house. By this time next week it will be for sale.  It is both exciting and nerve racking as we are still unsure of the road ahead, but it will be an adventure if nothing else!  The house is looking lovely.  Our bathrooms are finished, although I still need to take final pictures during daylight hours (there are never enough of those).  Alas, I managed to snap some pictures tonight of our bedroom.  It's looking lovely and every time I walk into this space, I feel like I am walking into a fancy hotel, minus the room service of course!  It's our own little sanctuary to retreat to after a long and tiring day.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to take more photos this coming week to show you how our house has come along.  I need to dig up some before photos too, as I can't believe at times, just how different everything is now.</p>
<p>Hoping to be here on a more regular basis, I've missed you all.  Jacinta x</p>
