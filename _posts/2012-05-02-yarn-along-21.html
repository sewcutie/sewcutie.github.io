<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/05/yarn-along-75.html">Ginny</a> from Small Things this week.</p>
<p>After my knitting issues last week, I've decided to cast on another project in the meantime, until I can face casting on my beret again.  The pattern is called Fear of Commitment Cowl.  The pattern is on <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/search#sort=best&amp;query=fear of commitment cowl">Ravelry</a>.  I'm knitting it to go with this <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=380">cloche</a> style hat I made last year.  The colour of the yarn is hard to get right, kind of a peacock blue, not grey/blue like in the picture. Doesn't help that I have taken the photo late at night.  It's a really straightforward pattern that 'should' knit up quickly, just as long as I leave it out of the reach of curious little fingers.</p>

<p>As for reading.  I just finished a Kindle book, Wild Montana Sky.  A good old romance novel.  Set in the 1800's in Boston and then rural Montana.  Rich girl falls for ranch boy kind of story.  Not bad considering it was a 99c special.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing what you have all been crafting and reading too.</p>
