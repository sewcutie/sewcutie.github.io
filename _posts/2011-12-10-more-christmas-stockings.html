<p>Yesterday I managed to finish a Christmas stocking each for Greg and I and another two for a dear friend's two gorgeous boys.  Ironically, this friend happend to call in very briefly today on her way to see her family, which was totally unexpected.  She doesn't live close by either.  Kind of like a Providence moment.  I like that.</p>

<p>I have also finished the hand embroidery on Tenneille's quilt (was actually meant for her birthday back in February!).  The pattern is called Summer Breeze by Sweetwater.</p>

<p>I am currently up to cutting out the bunting flags that will sit along the hand embroidered lines.  <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=1250">Tenneille's bedroom</a> curtains are also made out of Sweetwater fabric, and the yellow wall colour in her room is not disimilar to the yellow used in this fabric line, so the quilt will look lovely on her bed, once it's finished.  Fingers crossed it will be under the Christmas tree before midnight Christmas Eve!</p>
<p>I have decided to have an early night tonight.  Scarlett has a gymkhana day at her riding school tomorrow, which means an early start tomorrow morning.  The weather is looking pretty dismal too.  I'm hoping the rain will hold off for the fun filled day.  I hope you have a fun filled Sunday planned too.  Jacinta x</p>
