<p>I wanted to make something very special for Scarlett for her 8th birthday.  I ordered <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=411">fabric and a pattern</a> back in January so I would give myself enough time to make her a birthday quilt (Tenneille is still waiting for hers).  I was so close to finishing it for her birthday on Monday, but with Jairah's mishap Sunday, I didn't stand a chance.  4 days after her actual birthday, I finally finished her quilt.  I stayed up until 1.30am, hand sewing the binding while watching Breakfast At Tiffany's and Sleepless in Seattle to keep me company, as everyone had long gone to bed.  I bundled up her finished quilt and placed it at the end of her bed to find in the morning.  She loved it.  Oh, I am one happy mama.</p>

<p>I changed the material layout but not the pattern.  I left off some of the circle apliques and ric rac.  The back of the quilt is my own design and I am really happy with how it looks.  I used scraps of the material off cuts which, when joined with the white cotton, were just the right width to match the front.  I wanted the quilt to be reversible.  I machine quilted it, as I didn't have the time to hand quilt it.  I used a walking foot for all the lines and on the outside border I used a free motion foot and did basic swirls.  I must say it was fun doing free motion sewing.<br />
The best part is, I didn't really stuff anything up.  I cut the binding thinner than was suggested, but I prefer finer binding. I did rounded edges on the quilt, as I didn't want to have to do mitred corners.  I find is so much easer just to finish with a bias join instead.  I think I am a fan of rounded edge quilts from now on.  The quilt measures approximately 66"x66".</p>

<p>The pattern and fabric were purchased as a kit online at the <a href="http://www.fatquartershop.com/">Fat Quarter Shop</a> (very lovely to deal with and shipping was prompt).  The quilt pattern was called Marabella by Amy Hamberlin.  The fabric was by Henry Glass &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Now to get started on Tenneille's quilt!  Jacinta x</p>
