<p><em>- Keepin' It Real captures the true essence of family life that I know are fleeting, keeping this mama grounded -</em></p>
<p>The scenes that I happen upon around here are interesting to say the least.  Look who I found in the kitchen the other day.</p>

<p>Her name is Rainbow and she is one of Tenneille's favourites.  Don't you just love how she has been tied up and has a cushion to sit on.  Tenneille sure knows how to take care of her reptiles.  Rainbow sat up next to Tenneille and joined in the lunchtime conversation with an occasional roar and snacked on green olives and crunchy noodles.  I think the toys around here have it pretty good.</p>
<p>Hope your week is filled with real moments too.  Jacinta x</p>
