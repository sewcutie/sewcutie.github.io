<p>My kids love these quick and easy chicken nuggets.  There are only 3 ingredients and no artificial anything!  They are super fast to make and are great to serve on those nights when you have to get dinner made in a hurry.  They are pretty yummy for adults too.  Of course you could add herbs and maybe grated parmesan cheese if you want a little extra.</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />
Makes approximately 30 nuggets</p>
<p>2 chicken breast fillets, skin removed<br />
2-3 slices of bread<br />
salt to taste<br />
Oil for cooking</p>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>With a food processor, blend up the bread crumbs finely.  Put aside in a bowl.  Add the chicken and salt to the food processor and mix until the chicken resembles a fine mince.  Add a small handful of the prepared bread crumbs to the chicken mixture and just give it a quick pulse to mix the crumbs through.  Form the chicken mixture into desired size, then press each nugget into the bread crumbs, coating evenly and place on a plate.  Repeat until all the chicken mixture has been used.  Heat a frypan over a medium heat with enough oil to cover the base of the pan.  Once oil has heated up, place nuggets in the pan.  Brown on both sides.  Depending on the size of your pan, you will need to cook in batches.  Place the nuggets on a oven tray and finish off cooking in a preheated oven @160 degrees celsius for approximately 10 minutes.<br />
Remove from oven and serve with your favourite salad or vegetables and dipping sauce.</p>
