<p>I finally got around to taking some photo's of Scarlett wearing her dress I knitted.  I had hoped to get some photos outside in natural light, but this time of year that is next to impossible, along with the fact it is really hard to get photos of her without her tongue sticking out or silly faces (well I thought I better add one honorary photo). Thankfully she loves it and wore it to her School's winter festival last week.  It was the perfect outfit, as the evening was cold.   Notes for the dress can be found in my <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/Jacinta7t7/moda-vera-marvel-dress">Ravelry</a> page.</p>
