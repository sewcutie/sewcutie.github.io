<p>I am so excited by my recent purchase, a new (to me) sewing machine.  I purchased my Brother Innovis QC1000 (sounds like some sort of broom stick, wonder if it knows the directions to Hogwarts?) machine on ebay.  I had only recently started watching ebay for one and in less than a week, this one appeared.  I had to get it couriered down from Queensland, but it arrived very quickly and in one piece.</p>

<p>I tried it out yesterday and after an hour I was actually ready to sew a stitch!  It almost warrants a degree to use it, but I am sure I will figure it out as I go along.  I love the auto tread tension and it cuts the thread so the thread is at the back of your work.  I know that function alone is going to save me time.  It's kind of fun to have a touch screen too.  It seems to let you know if something is wrong and comes up with a little sad face and a short description of what needs checking.  Now if only it could come up with dinner suggestions and the ingredients, I'd be a very happy woman indeed.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to getting some sewing finished off.  A quilt for Tenneille for one. The machine came with a quilting table attachment, which will make it so much easier to piece her quilt together.<br />
I used my new machine to finished off a cover for my laptop yesterday.  I will write a post about it tomorrow.  Needless to say, my laptop now has a very comfy home indeed.    Jacinta x</p>
