<p>Well it seems I have hit a little over 100 posts here on my blog.  I figure that is something worth celebrating with you lovely people.  So I have for you, a book giveaway.  There are three books to choose from.  The winner will receive one new copy of one of the following books.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=582">A Felt Farm</a> by Rotraud Reinhard.  This is a gorgeous book with lots of projects to do.  It is well worth having if you are interested in felt craft or to just admire the beautiful pictures.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Afeltfarm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-612" title="Afeltfarm" src="assets/Afeltfarm-300x274.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="274" /></a></p>
<p>or <a href="http://www.oliverands.com/book/">Little Things to Sew</a>, by Oliver + S.  I have recently ordered myself a copy (I am still waiting for it's arrival), but I have only heard good things about it.  Oliver + S patterns are so lovely, I figure it would be a book worth having.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Oliverandsbook.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-614" title="Oliverandsbook" src="assets/Oliverandsbook.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="215" /></a></p>
<p>or one for the children, In my dreams I can fly, by Eveline Hasler &amp; Kathi Bhend.  This books has gorgeous illustrations and a lovely storyline.  We purchased Tenneille a copy of this book for her birthday and it is now one of our favourite bedtime stories.</p>
