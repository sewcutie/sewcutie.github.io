<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/05/yarn-along-78.html">Ginny</a> from Small Things for yarn along.</p>
<p>I've been knitting Jairah's <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/Jacinta7t7/aksel">Aksel</a> vest this week.  It is knitting up really quickly, thanks to using magic loop.  I wrote a post earlier this week on how I feel so silly for not learning this method earlier.  I didn't have the required yarn size the pattern called for, so I have used different sized needles and following the size 2 pattern instructions, I'm hoping for a size 4 outcome.  The pattern isn't fantastically written .  There are a few typos and some of the instructions are a little vague.  May have to make a few etra notes on my Ravelry page once the vest is finished.</p>
<p>I've knitted a lot more since I took the picture this morning, but the sun sets now about 5.30pm, so I didn't bother taking another picture, as the lighting will be wrong.</p>

<p>I've finally ordered some <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/bendigo-woollen-mills-luxury-10-ply">yarn</a> (Ruby colour) for my next project, Tea Leaves cardigan, fingers crossed it will arrive before the weekend, as I want to make a start.</p>
<p>As for reading, I finished my kindle book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Up-Country-Memories-ebook/dp/B0047GNDYI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337771256&amp;sr=8-2">Growing Up Country:</a> Memories of an Iowa Farm Girl, by Carol Bodensteiner.  It was a lovely read and I could relate to a lot of things she wrote about.  I can highly recommend it as a light, entertaining read.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing all your lovely creations.  Jacinta x</p>
