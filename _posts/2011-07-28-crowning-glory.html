<p>Scarlett was recently invited to one of her school friend's fairy/princess party.   She decided to go as a garden fairy, wearing the dress I made for her birthday last year.  She was desperate for a crown to wear and we decided that making one out of foliage would very fitting for a garden fairly.  So we all headed for a walk down our road in search of flowers, which is a feat in itself considering it's mid-winter and we live amongst a forrest.</p>
<p>It was lovely to wonder along and take in the gorgeous views that are just a stone's throw from our house and thankfully there were a few pretty flowers to pick along side the road.  Although, apparently there's a rather long process to picking just the right flower for the job and making sure one's dragon is placed just so in a basket, to prevent crushing freshly picked flowers (Tenneille's dragon that is).</p>

<p>Once we finally made it home there was a mad rush to get everyone lunch and dressed to get out the door (Tenneille had gone flower picking in her pjs!).  I constructed the main part of the crown for Scarlett from a vine and she decorated it with all the flowers and foliage.  We added some pretty ribbon to hang down at the back.</p>

<p>The crown was worn for all of 5 minutes at the party, of course.  All the girls looked gorgeous dressed up in their finest.  Especially when they were all on a jumping castle!</p>
<p>It was a special treat for this mama to sit and chat to other parents at the party while Greg took Tenneille and Jairah off to a park.   All the princesses and fairies went home very happy with balloons in hand and smiles on faces.  Jacinta x</p>
