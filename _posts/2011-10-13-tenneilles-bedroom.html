<p>It has taken months to get the final finishes done on Tenneille's bedroom.  I am so happy with how it has turned out.  It is totally different to how the room started off.  All the rooms in the house were originally beige (I mean everything, walls, cupboards, inside of cupboards, I think you get the picture).  The flooring was originally carpet which had well and truly reached its use by date and the curtains were really tacky.  But now, it is pure bliss.  The splash of yellow on the wall brings the sunshine indoors and a smile to my face every time I enter Tenneille's room.   So, without further ado, here 'tis....</p>

<p>The curtain material is by Sweetwater and is from their Sunkissed range.  I can't believe how perfectly it matches the paint.</p>
