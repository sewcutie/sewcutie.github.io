<p>It seems the knitting bug has now well and truly bitten me.  I finally got into the city this week and purchased my belated Mother's Day gift.  A KnitPro interchangeable needle set.  I wasn't sure whether to get the metal needles or the wooden, but after chatting to the girls at the store, they highly recommended the metal needles, so I decided to go with that.  However, I should have done my sums, as it would have been a little cheaper to purchase them separately, as the pack comes with a couple of extras, I don't need and there are a couple of sizes not included, that I will need to purchase separately.  You live and learn.</p>

<p>I am yet to try them out, but will let you know once I have tried them out.  Jacinta x</p>
