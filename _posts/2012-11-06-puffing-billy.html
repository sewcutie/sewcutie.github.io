<p>As a belated birthday present for Jairah, our train obsessed boy, we took a ride on Puffing Billy.  For those of you who are not familiar, Puffing Billy (well actually I think there are at least 3 different Puffing Billy engines) is a steam train that runs between Belgrave and Gembrook in Victoria's Dandenong Ranges.  Sunday was a most glorious day weather wise, perfect for enjoying a train ride, which meant every other person had the same idea, as we ended up waiting an hour and a half to buy tickets!  Thankfully the kids handled it well and were still excited by the time we got on the train.  I love the fact that you can still sit on the edge of the train carriages and dangle your legs over the side while the train is moving.  The girls happily hung out the side of the train all the way to Emerald.  We hopped off at Emerald and headed off for ice cream and a play in the park.  Our return trip to Belgrave was just as fun and the kids had the best time.</p>

There were 13 carriages![/caption]</p>

<p>I can highly recommend going on the train, although if you are catching the train from Belgrave on the weekend in the warmer months, be prepared to wait.  Otherwise consider catching it from Gembrook, Emerald or Lakeside Emerald, as the wait is generally not as long there.  It is suitable for all ages and you will be assured of having fun and the scenery is just gorgeous.  It is volunteer run and they are all so enthusiastic about their roles which I think adds a little magic to the whole experience.</p>
