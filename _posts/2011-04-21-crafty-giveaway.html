<p>My gift to you this Easter is a chance to win a new copy of Pass Me A Smile by Toyoko Sugiwaka.  I found it today at a book store and knew it had to be yours (well I hope it will be for one of you!). It is full of cute little projects from hugging bears (my favourite), a birdie house, a winking cat tea cozy, cute bunnies, donkeys and more.</p>
<p>Entry is open to international readers.  Only 1 winner.  Please leave a comment in the comments section.  For a bonus entry/entries, mention it on Twitter and/or blog about it with a link back to here.  For each bonus entry, leave a separate comment please.  You have up to 3 chances to win.  Be sure to leave contact details, should you win.  Comments open until Tuesday 26th April.</p>
