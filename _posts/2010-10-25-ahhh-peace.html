<p>I'm not referring to the fact the kids are asleep (bless their little souls they are all fast asleep), I have just returned from yoga.  I find I come home with every cell of my body relaxed, revived and just a little bit quieter within, ready to face another week of whatever lays ahead.</p>
<p>It's so lovely to walk into the yoga space each week, along with other people who are there with the best of intentions.  Everyone leaves, smiles on faces and lovely conversations exchanged.  I must declare, Mondays are my favourite day of the week (should I be ducking for cover right now??).  Anyway, I'm so relaxed, I am actually finding it difficult to focus enough to type this blog entry.  So I am going to leave it at that.</p>
<p>May your day be filled with bliss, peace and just a little bit of quietness within.</p>
