<p>To pretty up the house to sell, I wanted some lovely cushions to go on the sofa.  I was short for time and went looking in stores.  I found a couple on sale in Target, but couldn't justify spending too much.  So I came home and in an afternoon sewing frenzy, whipped up a couple more cushions.</p>
