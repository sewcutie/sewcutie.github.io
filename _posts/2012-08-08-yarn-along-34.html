<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2012/08/yarn-along-special-guest-post.html">Ginny</a>, or should I say Ginny's hubby this week, from Small Things.</p>
<p>My photo is a little on the mysterious side this week, as I am working on a gift for a friend.  I'm using Zara Chiné which is a gorgeous merino wool.  It is so soft to work with and I am loving the denim colour, which has a slight fleck of colour through it.  I'm excited to say I am using my own pattern, which I will share once my project is complete.</p>

<p>I have had good intentions of reading my book, Small Wonders by Barbara Kingsolver, but the truth be told, I am turning into a Kindle (on my iphone) gal.  I often don't get a chance to read until it is lights out for the night and at least I can sneak in a couple of pages on my phone before my eyes start drooping!  Hence I bought a new Kindle book this week, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Kashmir-Shawl-ebook/dp/B005AYIA3K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344418823&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+kashmir+shawl">The Kashmir Shawl</a>, by Rosie Thomas.  It's about a woman, Mair, who goes on a journey to try and find out more about a shawl which belonged to her grandmother, whom she never met.  I am only a little way in, but fingers crossed I like it, I mean it's kind of about knitting, so that has to account for something, doesn't it!  The front cover is pretty too, for me, that goes a long way.  Has the design of a book's front cover ever enticed you to purchase it?</p>
<p>Can't wait to see what all you talented women have been up to this week.  Jacinta x</p>
