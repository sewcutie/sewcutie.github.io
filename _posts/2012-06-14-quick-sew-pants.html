<p>I spent just one hour today sewing, and actually finished what I started (shocked, I know!).  I made the Oliver + S Nature Walk pants.  What a lovely simple pattern.  The instructions are very clear and there isn't much to making them up.  This is an older pattern, so not sure if it is still available.  The sizing goes from 6 months to 4 years.  I made size 3.  They are fairly slim fitting, so those who use cloth nappies/diapers on their little ones may have a little trouble fitting in the tooshie department, other than that, no complaints about the pattern.  I didn't hem them, as they were the perfect length.  I used cotton/polyester fleece, same stuff tracksuits are made from, which has a nice stretch, so should be nice and cosy for Jairah.  He seems to be going through multiple clothes during the day, due to lots of lovely mud, so they will get plenty of wear.  In fact, I think I might even make him another pair.  I would like some in my size, they would be great for yoga.</p>

<p>Jairah happily posed for photos.  He is such a fun little boy and makes everyday so sunny and bright with just a little mischief mixed in for good measure.  Jacinta x</p>
