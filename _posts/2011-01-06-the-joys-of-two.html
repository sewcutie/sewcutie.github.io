<p>I must say that two is one of my favourite ages (should I be ducking right now?).  Jairah is learning more words as the each day passes.  Quite the little talker.  I love that he has certain universal words for what he wants.  He was eating grapes today and when he asked for more he said 'more nuts, more balls'.  Well, I suppose they are ball like and nut like in shape!  Door also has universal meaning.  Not only does it mean an actual door, it also means he wants the lid off something or wants you to open a box, bag or help with a toy.</p>
<p>Whenever he wakes up from a sleep the first thing he says to me is 'el-lo Mama'.   Often, throughout the day Jairah takes my hand as we walk around the house or the garden, with him saying 'Lub-i-lee day' (lovely day).  Melts my heart.  Sure we have had many in-depth conversations, about what, I do not know, but it is the joy I see on his face, while I am engaging in these conversations with him, tell me I seem to be saying the right thing at the right time (mother's intuition, right?).</p>
<p>We have Fantasy Island moments whenever a plane or helicopter go over our house.  He will shout, rather enthusiastically, 'd-plane, d-plane'.  Oh yes, he is obsessed with planes, trains, automobiles anything with wheels actually!</p>
<p>He calls Tenneille 't-neille or Na-neille' and Scarlett is 'Lar-let or Lar-lee'. Scarlett loves him, Tenneille, well, she sees him as the babe who took over most of mama's lap, even though there is equal room for them all. Jairah often screams Scarlett's name rather loudly.  I suspect it is because Scarlett is very in touch with her emotions and isn't afraid to use them, regularly.  He is learning from the best after all.</p>
<p>The love shared between Tenneille and Jairah goes a little like this:</p>
<p>Jairah: 'My mama'</p>
<p>Tenneille: 'No, my mama'</p>
<p>Jairah: 'MY MAMA'</p>
<p>Tenneille: 'NO, she's my mama and I love her more than anyone else in the whole world'.  This is followed by some hitting, elbowing and just a wee bit of screaming.  Of course I am in the middle of them fighting to get my lap space all to themselves.  Apparently I can be quite the popular person around these parts!</p>
<p>On the subject of screaming, I only have to brace my ears once in a while, while he feels the need to scream at something or someone, that isn't doing what he wants (like the example given above).  Oh yes, he gives the girls a run for their money in that department.</p>
<p>Sometimes he just wonders around singing 'happy, happy' over and over.  He always has a smile, even if up to some sort of <a href="http://www.embracingitall.com/?p=68">mischief</a>.  'Oh no, ho dear' feature heavily in his vocabulary too, for many assorted reasons!</p>
<p>To our little boy, you bring sunshine into our lives and put smiles on our faces.  xx Mama &amp; Co.</p>
