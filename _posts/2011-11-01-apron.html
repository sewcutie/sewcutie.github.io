<p>We celebrated mum's 60th birthday over the weekend.  Unfortunately as it was a whirl wind trip, I didn't really take many photos.  Although mum found an apron she made when she was Scarlett's age.  She gave it to Scarlett to wear while the girls helped make a birthday cake for mum.  The apron is over 50 years old and is very darling.</p>
