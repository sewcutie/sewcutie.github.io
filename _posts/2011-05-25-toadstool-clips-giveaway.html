<p>Well if you haven't noticed, I love a giveaway.  I was going to do this around my birthday, but with two weeks of sick children, I didn't get to it.</p>
<p>Included in this giveaway is a pair of toadstool hair clips with a gift tag and little pouch to contain the clips.  Please leave a comment to be entered into the giveaway.  Feel free to tweet about it for a second chance.  It's open to international lovelies.  I will close comments on Sunday 29th May, AEST.</p>
