<p>In an effort to change the mood of things around here today (oh yes, grumpy was reigning supreme, the little people that is), I decided that afternoon tea outdoors was in order.  I love baking, but don't make a lot of things for the kids with sugar.  Ah, but of course there are always exceptions!  Today was one of them.  I flicked through a biscuit recipe book I had on the shelf, but nothing seemed right.  So what do I do, I make up a recipe instead.</p>
<p>These biscuits are very quick to make and have a slight cake like centre and a crunchy outer.  Best of all, they aren't too laden with sugar.  They disappeared off the plate in a matter of minutes.  It certainly changed the mood and made the afternoon much more pleasant indeed.</p>
<p>I was going to call these biscuits, Citrus Spelt Biscuits, but really, that sounds terrible.  Munch away the grumps is so much more fitting, don't you think?</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients -<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;"> (makes approx. 20 biscuits)</span></strong></p>
<p>1 cup white spelt flour<br />
1/2 tsp bi-carb of soda<br />
1 tsp cream of tartar<br />
1/4 cup sugar<br />
80gm butter<br />
1 egg<br />
1 tbsp milk<br />
1 tsp vanilla essence<br />
zest of 1 orange<br />
Cooking spray</p>
<p><strong>Method -</strong></p>
<p>Cream butter, sugar and essence.  Add egg and beat until combined.  Mix in zest, sifted flour, bi-carb, cream of tartar &amp; milk.  Stir until well combined.<br />
Spoon teaspoonfuls of mixture onto lined and greased oven trays.  Bake in moderate oven for approximately 10-12 minutes.   Remove from oven and cool slightly before turning the biscuits onto a cooling rack.</p>
<p><strong>Variation -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want a crunchier biscuit, omit the tablespoon of milk.</li>
<li>Add the zest of 1 lemon for a slightly different flavour.</li>
</ul>
