<p>I can't believe I have been so absent from my blog.  If you are reading this, "hello!", I've missed you so.  Things have been rather crazy around here of late, in fact, this blog post has been sitting in my drafts folder since mid February!  Have some pretty big news to share, but I will have to keep you in suspense just a little longer before I can share.  As for life in general, things are pretty good.  The girls are loving being back in school and have settled back into our weekly routine.  We have had a really beautiful summer with lots of warm weather and lots of trips to the beach.  Autumn is definitely starting to make it's presence felt here in the hills.  I've noticed this last week leaves are starting to turn colour.  Autumn certainly is the most beautiful time of the year in the Dandenong Ranges.</p>
<p>I'll be back soon to keep you up to date with the craziness that is our life.</p>
