<p>I stated this cowl on Wednesday and finished it Friday.  It was such a quick and fun knit.  It's for a friend's birthday next month.  I washed and blocked it today and it has come up so soft, not at all scratchy and is long enough that you can wrap it 2-3 times. My Ravelry notes can be found <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/embracingitall/a-grey-loop">here</a>.  I love that the original pattern is written more like a guide, so adding your own design is all part of the fun.  I foresee many more of these being knitted in my future!  I think it may well have become my new go-to gift project.  Do you have a favourite you fall back on for gift giving?</p>
