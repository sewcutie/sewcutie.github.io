<p>Sounds rather fancy doesn't it!  The championship was held this weekend past and was the last Nippers meet for the season.  It was a cold, blustery day.  Scarlett was none too impressed about having to go.  Of course once she was there, it was all good.  The kids completed in their age groups.  Scarlett's age group competed in a flag race, run/wade/run race and a board race.</p>
<p>The water was really choppy and the current was running parellel to the beach, so the younger ones had a hard time going out into the bay in the board race.  They got around the buoys eventually and back onto the sand.  Scarlett and the girl next to her kept bumping into each other, sending each other off course.  It was kind of funny to watch.   She almost placed in the flag race, but of course the boys were all about winning at all costs and she was shoved out of the way.  Oh well, I have a great action shot of her diving for the flag in the previous heat.</p>

<p>We finished up the day with a sausage sizzle and we went back to a friends place for a catch up we had been planning all season, only too us 6 months to organise!  It has been fun and a great excuse to get to the beach every week.  We are hoping Scarlett and Tenneille will continue next year.<br />
Nippers is a great way of introducing your children to water safety while having lots of fun at the same time.  It is very family orientated, which is why we joined Scarlett up.  <a href="http://www.sls.com.au/nippers">Here</a> is a link to check out if you're interested in finding out more.</p>
