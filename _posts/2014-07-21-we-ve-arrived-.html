<p>Just a quick up date to say we are now in Boston.  So far, so good.  Of course we have had to wade through mountains of paperwork and double checking of documents to get here, but we made it with most of our sanity intact!  The weather has been gorgeous and we've been exploring the city and seeing what it has to offer.  We are loving Boston so far, lots of friendly people and such a pretty city.  There are so many lovely gardens to visit and I am a sucker for lovely old buildings.  We have secured a home out it the suburbs, so will be relocating there next month.  For now we are living in a fully furnished house in Jamaica Plain.  It is very handy to public transport and we are getting the hang of catching the train, a novelty for us and the kids love riding the train.</p>
<p>I hope to keep updating our adventures when the time permits.</p>
