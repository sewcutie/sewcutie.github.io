<p>Don't you just love what comes out of the mouth of babes!  Scarlett and Tenneille have taken great joy in trying to get Jairah to repeat what they say to him (thankfully it is quite sweet the things they are trying to teach him!).  Anyway, the other day Scarlett asked him to say something and he repeated it back word perfect.  Her response was "He said it like a real boy".  So there you have it, Jairah is now real and not just a living doll!  Now if only I had it on video.</p>
