<p>I have finally finished my first Steiner/Waldorf doll.  I recently participated in a doll making course which ran for 6 weeks.  Of course, I didn't get to finish it before the class ended as I missed one of the classes and I spent lots of the time chatting!  But I had done enough to finish her at home.  The girls absolutely love her and Scarlett thinks her little smocked dress is very pretty.  I think I am going to have to make more dresses so that the other dolls don't have dress envy!  The smocked dress pattern is one I made myself.  If I ever get organised enough, I will put it in the tutorial section.<br />
She is made out of organic cotton.  Her hair is a wool/silk blend.  I can't fathom the thought of cutting her hair, so I think I will leave it long.  The fabric I used for her dress came from a craft swap I participated in last year, on a forum that has now closed down.  The fabric is where I got the inspiration for the dolls name - Violet.</p>

<p>I am hoping the girls will love playing with Violet and she doesn't meet the demise of the other Steiner dollies, who I often find strewn throughout the house, with little or no clothing!</p>
