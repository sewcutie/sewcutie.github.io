<p>Now that I have posted Jairah's birthday, I feel I want to share his actual birth day.  He was born into his mama's arms at home in water at approximately 7.08am on Thursday 9th October 2008.  It was a very quick labour, only about 2 1/2 hours from first contraction to arriving earth side.  He was 9lb 9oz and just scrumptious.  I had the support of my family and two midwives and a very special friend was chosen to be part of my birthing support team.   I felt so very honoured and held throughout Jairah's birth.  Couldn't have done it any other way.</p>

<p>I really struggled with boy names and in the last couple of weeks I got very serious about trying to find something I really loved.  We didn't know the sex of the baby, but towards the end of the pregnancy I had an inkling it could be a boy.  In the end we had three boy names, Jarrah, Jairah and Jonah (apparently I had a thing for J's!).  His middle name was always going to be Finley.  On the morning of his birth, as we layed snuggled up in bed with a new babe in arms, Greg and I discussed what our son was to be called.  Greg was leaning towards Jonah and I, Jairah.  After a bit of persuasive talk, Greg agreed with me that we didn't know in person, anyone called Jairah, so that was it - Jairah Finley it was.  I am still in love with his name and it suites him oh so well.  We have had people ask if we made up the name Jairah, but no, we didn't.  Apparently it is an old biblical name but originally spelt Jireh.  It means "God provides".  Finley means "fair-haired courageous one", which is very fitting indeed!</p>
