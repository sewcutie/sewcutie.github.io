<p>I got home late the other night and of course still had to prepare dinner.  Jairah was needing me and I needed my hands free to get dinner on the stove.  I figured our water loving boy would be very happy sitting in a tub.  So in the middle of the kitchen I placed a plastic container and filled with water, bubbles and a few bath essentials and enter, one happy boy.</p>

<p>I'm happy to say we had dinner and peace reigned once again.  (Oh, and just incase anyone is concerned, he was at arms reach the entire time).   Jacinta x</p>
