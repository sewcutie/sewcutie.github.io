<p>Joining in with <a href="http://www.gsheller.com/2011/07/yarn-along.html">Ginny at Small Things </a>yarn along this week.</p>
<p>I have made pretty good progress on Jairah's jumper/sweater this week while staying at mum's.  I should have it finished before the end of the week if all goes to plan, especially as the weather is too wet to do much else.  I have plans to go to a friend's place for craft tonight, so will aim to get started on the sleeves.  But knowing me, will probably do more talking than knitting.</p>

<p>I am reading a kindle freebee called, Letters of a Woman Homesteader, by Elinore Pruitt Stewart.  I have only just started it, but so far, so good. I finished reading The Secret Holocaust Diaries by Nonna Bannister.  I found it hard to put down and read it in a couple of days.  I'm glad she write about her experiences, as tragic as they were.  It's the kind of book that stays with you and makes you realise how good things really are.  It reminded me of a book I read in high school called Elli, by Livia E. Bitton-Jackson.  It too is based on a holocaust experience.</p>
<p>I can't wait to see what you have all been knitting and reading this week. Jacinta x</p>
